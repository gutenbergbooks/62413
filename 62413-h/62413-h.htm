<h4><i>About this book</i></h4>
<p>The story of Cowpens, as told in these pages, is ever
fresh and will live in memory as long as America&rsquo;s
wars are studied and talked about. The author is
Thomas Fleming, a biographer, military historian,
and novelist of distinction. His works range from an
account of the Pilgrims&rsquo; first year in America to
biographies of Jefferson and Franklin and novels of
three American wars. <i>Downright Fighting, The
Story of Cowpens</i> is a gripping tale by a master
storyteller of what has been described as the
patriot&rsquo;s best fought battle of the Revolutionary
War.</p>
<p>The National Park System, of which Cowpens
National Battlefield is a unit, consists of more than
340 parks totaling 80 million acres. These parks
represent important examples of the nation&rsquo;s natural
and cultural inheritance.</p>
<h4><i>National Park Handbooks</i></h4>
<p>National Park handbooks, compact introductions to
the natural and historical places administered by the
National Park Service, are designed to promote
public understanding and enjoyment of the parks.
Each handbook is intended to be informative
reading and a useful guide to park features. More
than 100 titles are in print. They are sold at parks
and by mail from the Superintendent of Documents,
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.
20402.</p>

deploying into a line of battle.
Locally it was known as
the Green River Road. Four
or five miles beyond the position
held by Morgan, the
road crossed the Broad River
at Island Ford. For opposite
reasons, Morgan and Tarleton
each thought this field and its
relationship to the Broad
River gave him the advantage.</p>

<p>As battlefields go, this one is fairly plain: a grassy
clearing in a scrub-pine forest with no obvious military
advantages. There are a thousand meadows like
it in upstate South Carolina. This one is important
because two centuries ago armies clashed here in
one of the dramatic battles of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>In January 1781, this clearing was a frontier pasturing
ground, known locally as the Cowpens. The
name came from the custom of upcountry stock
raisers wintering their cattle in the lush vales around
Thicketty Mountain. It was probably squatters&rsquo;
ground, though one tradition says that it belonged to
a person named Hannah, while another credits it to
one Hiram Saunders, a wealthy loyalist who lived
close by.</p>
<p>The meadow was apparently well known to frontiersmen.
The previous October, a body of over-mountain
men, pursuing Patrick Ferguson and his
loyalist corps, made camp here and, according to
another tradition, hauled the Tory Saunders out of
bed at night seeking information on Ferguson&rsquo;s whereabouts.
Finding no sign of an army passing through,
they butchered some cattle and after refreshing themselves
took up the trail again.</p>
<p>When the troops of Continental General Daniel
Morgan filed onto this field on a dank January day in
1781, they were an army on the run, fleeing an
implacable and awesome enemy, the dreaded British
Legion of Col. Banastre Tarleton. Their patrols reported
that they were substantially outnumbered,
and by any military measure of the time, they were
clearly outclassed. They were a mixed force of some
830 soldiers&mdash;320 seasoned Continentals, a troop of
light dragoons, and the rest militia. Though some
of the militia were former Continentals, known to be
stalwarts in battle, most were short-term soldiers
whose unpredictable performance might give a commander
pause when battle lines were drawn. Their
foe, Tarleton&rsquo;s Legion, was the best light corps in the
British army in America, and it was now reinforced
by several hundred British regulars and an artillery
company.</p>
<p>On this afternoon of January 16, 1781, the men of
Morgan&rsquo;s army had run long enough. They were
spoiling for a fight. They knew Tarleton as the enemy
whose troopers at the Waxhaws had sabered to
death Americans in the act of surrendering. From
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
him they had taken their own merciless victory cry,
&ldquo;Tarleton&rsquo;s quarter.&rdquo; In the months after the infamous
butchery, as Tarleton&rsquo;s green-jacketed dragoons
attacked citizens and soldiers alike and pillaged farms
and burned homes, they had come to characterize
him as &ldquo;Bloody Tarleton.&rdquo; He was bold, fearless,
often rash and always a savage enemy, and they
seethed to have a go at him.</p>
<p>Morgan chose this ground as much for its tactical
advantages as from necessity. Most of his militia
lacked bayonets and could not stand up to bayonet-wielding
redcoats in a line of battle. Morgan saw
advantage in this unlikely field: a river to the rear to
discourage the ranks from breaking, rising ground
on which to post his regulars, a scattering of trees to
hinder the enemy&rsquo;s cavalry, and marsh on one side to
thwart flanking maneuvers. It was ground on which
he could deploy his troops to make the most of their
abilities in the kind of fighting that he expected
Tarleton to bring on.</p>
<p>In the narrative that follows, Thomas Fleming, a
historian with the skills of a novelist, tells the authentic,
dramatic story that climaxed on the next morning.
In his fully fleshed chronicle, intimate in detail
and rich in insights, he relates the complex events
that took shape in the Southern colonies after the
War of the Revolution stalemated in the north. He
describes the British strategy for conquering the rebel
Americans and the Americans&rsquo; counterstrategy.
An important part of this story is an account of the
daringly unorthodox campaign of commander-in-chief
George Washington&rsquo;s trusted lieutenant Nathanael
Greene, who finally &ldquo;flushed the bird&rdquo; that Washington
caught at Yorktown. Upon reading <i>Downright
Fighting</i>, one understands why the Homeric battle
between two splendid antagonists on the morning of
January 17, 1781, became the beginning of the end of
the British hold on America.</p>

<h2><span class="small">The Anatomy of Victory</span></h2>
<h3><b>1</b></h3>
<p>All night the two men rode northwest along the
muddy winding roads of South Carolina&rsquo;s back country.
Twice they had to endure bone-chilling swims
across swollen creeks. Now, in the raw gray cold of
dawn, they faced a more formidable obstacle&mdash;the
wide, swift Pacolet River. They rode along it until
they found the ford known as Grindal Shoals. Ordinarily,
it would have been easy to cross. But the river
was high. The icy water lapped at their thighs as the
weary horses struggled to keep their feet in the
rushing current. &ldquo;Halt,&rdquo; snarled a voice from the
river bank. &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said the lead rider, 25-year-old Joseph
McJunkin.</p>
<p>The sentry barked the password for the night.
McJunkin and his companion, James Park, did not
know the countersign. McJunkin told the sentry he
had an important message for General Morgan. The
sentry told him not to move or he would put a hole
through his chest. He called for the captain of the
guard. The two riders had to sit there in the icy river
while the captain made his way to the bank. Once
more McJunkin insisted he had a message for General
Morgan. It was from Colonel Pickens. It was
very important.</p>
<p>The captain invited the two men onto the north
bank of the Pacolet. Above them, on a wooded hill,
was the camp of Brig. Gen. Daniel Morgan of the
Continental Army of the United States. Around
Morgan&rsquo;s tent, about 830 men were lighting fires and
beginning to cook their breakfasts, which consisted
largely of cornmeal. From a barrel in a wagon, a
commissary issued a gill (four ounces) of rum. Most
added water to it and put it in their canteens. A few
gulped the fiery liquid straight, in spite of the frowns
of their officers. Some 320 of the men still wore
pieces of uniforms&mdash;a tattered blue coat here, a
ragged white wool waistcoat there, patched buff
breeches. In spite of the rainy, cold January weather,
few had shoes on their feet. These men were Continentals&mdash;the
names by which patriot regular army
soldiers, usually enlisted for three years, were known.</p>
<p>The rest of the army wore a varied assortment of
civilian clothing. Hunting shirts of coarse homespun
material known as linsey-woolsey, tightly belted, or
loose wool coats, also homespun, leather leggings,
wool breeches. These men were militia&mdash;summoned
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
from their homes to serve as emergency soldiers for
short periods of time. Most were from western
districts of the Carolinas. About 120 were riflemen
from Virginia, committed to serving for six months.
Most of these were former Continentals. They were
being paid by other Virginians who hired them as
substitutes to avoid being drafted into the army.
After five years of war, patriotism was far from
universal in America.</p>
<p>In his tent, Morgan listened to the message
McJunkin brought from Col. Andrew Pickens: the
British were advancing in force. Morgan whirled and
roused from a nearby camp cot a small groggy man
who had managed to sleep through McJunkin&rsquo;s bad
news. His name was Baron de Glaubech. He was one
of the many French volunteers who were serving
with the Americans. &ldquo;Baron,&rdquo; Morgan said. &ldquo;Get up.
Go back and tell Billy that Benny is coming and he
must meet me tomorrow evening at Gentleman
Thompson&rsquo;s on the east side of Thicketty Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sixty-three years later, when he was 80, Joseph
McJunkin remembered these words with their remarkable
combination of informality and decision.
It was part of the reason men like young McJunkin
trusted Daniel Morgan. It was somehow reassuring
to hear him call Lt. Col. William Washington, commander
of the American cavalry and second cousin
to Gen. George Washington, &ldquo;Billy.&rdquo; It was even
more reassuring to hear him call Lt. Col. Banastre
Tarleton, commander of the British army that was
coming after them, &ldquo;Benny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding to this reassurance was 45-year-old Daniel
Morgan&rsquo;s appearance and reputation. He was over
six feet tall, with massive shoulders and arms, toughened
from his youthful years as a wagonmaster in
western Virginia. In his younger days he had been
one of the champion sluggers and wrestlers of the
Shenandoah Valley. His wide volatile face could still
flash from cheerfulness to pugnacity in an instant. In
the five years of the Revolution, Morgan had become
a living legend: the man who led a reckless
assault into the very mouths of British cannon on the
barricaded streets of Quebec in 1775, whose corps of
some 570 riflemen had been the cutting edge of the
American army that defeated the British at Saratoga
in 1777.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>He was a giant of a man, 6 feet
2 inches, with a full face, blue
eyes, dark hair, and a classic
nose. As a youth in western
Virginia, he had drifted into
wagoneering along the roads
of the frontier. His education
was slight. Good-natured and
gregarious, he was, like his
companions of the road, rowdy
and given to drink, gambling,
and fighting. In time, he married,
settled down, went into
farming, and became a man of
substance in his community.</p>
<p>He was already a hero of
the Revolution when he took
command of Greene&rsquo;s light
troops in late 1780. His rifle
corps had fought with distinction
at Quebec (1775) and
Saratoga (1777). But after
being passed over for promotion,
unfairly he thought, he
retired to his Virginia farm.
When the South fell to British
armies in 1780, he put aside
his feelings and welcomed a
new command.</p>
<p>Morgan was at home in the
slashing, partisan warfare in
the South. At Cowpens the
mixed force of regulars and
militia that he led so ably
destroyed Tarleton&rsquo;s dreaded
Legion, depriving Cornwallis
of a wing of swift-moving light
troops essential to his army&rsquo;s
operation.</p>

<p>The lower South became the decisive theatre
of the Revolutionary War. After the struggle
settled into stalemate in the north, the British
mounted their second campaign to conquer
the region. British expeditionary forces captured
Savannah in late 1778 and Charleston in
May 1780. By late in that summer, most of
South Carolina was pacified, and a powerful
British army under Cornwallis was poised to
sweep across the Carolinas into Virginia.</p>
<p>This map traces the marches of Cornwallis
(red) and his wily adversary Nathanael Greene
(blue). The campaign opened at Charleston in
August 1780 when Cornwallis marched north
to confront Gen. Horatio Gates moving south
with a Continental army. It ended at Yorktown
in October 1781 with Cornwallis&rsquo;s surrender of
the main British army in America. In between
were 18 months of some of the hardest campaigning
and most savage fighting of the war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>On this 14th of January, 1781, a great many people
in South Carolina and North Carolina were badly in
need of the reassurance that Daniel Morgan communicated.
The year just completed had been a series
of military and political disasters, with only a few
flickering glimpses of hope for the Americans who
had rebelled against George III and his Parliament in
1776. In 1780 the British had adopted a new strategy.
Leaving enough troops to pin down George Washington&rsquo;s
main American army near New York, the
British had sent another army south to besiege
Charleston. On May 12, 1780, the city and its
defending army, under the command of a Massachusetts
general named Benjamin Lincoln, surrendered.
Two hundred and forty-five regular officers and
2,326 enlisted men became captives along with an
equal number of South Carolina militia; thousands
of muskets, dozens of cannon, and tons of irreplaceable
gunpowder and other supplies were also lost.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/i09.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">Gen. Nathanael Greene
(1742-86) served with distinction
in two roles: as quartermaster
general of the army
after others had failed in the
post, and as the strategist
of the decisive Southern
Campaign.</p>
</div>
<p>It was the worst American defeat of the war. The
Continental Congress responded by sending south
Gen. Horatio Gates, commander of the army that
had beaten the British at Saratoga. Gates brought
with him about 1,200 Maryland and Delaware Continentals
and called on the militia of North Carolina
and Virginia to support him. On August 16, 1780,
outside the village of Camden, S.C., the Americans
encountered an army commanded by Charles, Earl
Cornwallis, the most aggressive British general in
America. Cornwallis ordered a bayonet charge. The
poorly armed, inexperienced militia panicked and
fled. The Continentals fought desperately for a time
but were soon surrounded and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Both North and South Carolina now seemed prostrate.
There was no patriot army in either state
strong enough to resist the thousands of British regulars.
Georgia had been conquered by a combined
British naval and land force in late 1778 and early
1779. There were rumors that America&rsquo;s allies, France
and Spain, were tired of the war and ready to call a
peace conference. Many persons thought that the
Carolinas and Georgia would be abandoned at this
conference. In the Continental Congress, some already
considered them lost. &ldquo;It is agreed on all hands
the whole state of So. Carolina hath submitted to the
British Government as well as Georgia,&rdquo; a Rhode
Island delegate wrote. &ldquo;I shall not be surprised to
hear N. Carolina hath followed their example.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/i09a.jpg" alt="" width="388" height="599" />
<p class="pcap">Thomas Sumter (1732-1832),
a daring and energetic partisan
leader, joined the patriot
side after Tarleton&rsquo;s dragoons
burned his Santee
home. His militia harassed
and sometimes defeated the
British in the savage civil war
that gripped the South Carolina
backcountry in 1780-81.</p>
</div>
<p>British spokesmen eagerly promoted this idea.
They were more numerous in the Carolinas than
most 20th-century Americans realize. The majority
of them were American born&mdash;men and women
whom the rebel Americans called tories and today
are usually known as loyalists. Part of the reason for
this defection was geographical. The people of the
back country had long feuded with the wealthier
lowlanders, who controlled the politics of the two
States. The lowlanders had led the Carolinas into the
war with the mother country, and many back-country
people sided with the British in the hope of humbling
the haughty planters. Some of these counter-revolutionists
sincerely believed their rights would
be better protected under the king. Another large
group thought the British were going to win the war
and sided with them in the hope of getting rich on
the rebels&rsquo; confiscated estates. A third, more passive
group simply lacked the courage to oppose their
aggressive loyalist neighbors.</p>
<p>The British set up forts, garrisoned by regulars
and loyalists, in various districts of South Carolina
and told the people if they swore an oath of allegiance
to the king and promised to lay down their
weapons, they would be protected and forgiven for
any and all previous acts of rebellion. Thousands of
men accepted this offer and dropped out of the war.</p>
<p>But some South Carolinians refused to submit to
royal authority. Many of them were Presbyterians,
who feared that their freedom to worship would be
taken away from them or that they would be deprived
of the right to vote, as Presbyterians were in
England. Others were animated by a fundamental
suspicion of British intentions toward America. They
believed there was a British plot to force Americans
to pay unjust taxes to enable England&rsquo;s aristocratic
politicians and their followers to live in luxury.</p>
<p>Joseph McJunkin was one of the men who had
refused to surrender. He had risen from private to
major in the militia regiment from the Union district
of South Carolina. After the fall of Charleston, he
and his friends hid gunpowder and ammunition in
hollow logs and thickets. But in June 1780, they were
badly beaten by a battalion of loyalist neighbors and
fled across the Broad River. They were joined by
men from the Spartan, Laurens, and Newberry districts.
At the Presbyterian Meeting House on Bullocks
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Creek, they debated whether to accept British protection.
McJunkin and a few other men rose and
vowed they would fight on. Finally someone asked
those who wanted to fight to throw up their hats and
clap their hands. &ldquo;Every hat went up and the air
resounded with clapping and shouts of defiance,&rdquo;
McJunkin recalled.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/i10.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Short, disciplined to the life
of a soldier, yet plain and
gentle in manner, Francis
Marion (the figure at left) was
equally brilliant as an officer
of regulars and a partisan
leader of militia. To the British
he was as elusive as a fox,
marching his brigade at night,
rarely sleeping twice in the
same camp, and vanishing
into the swamps when opposed
by a larger force.</p>
</div>
<p>A few days later, these men met Thomas Sumter,
a former colonel in the South Carolina Continentals.
He had fled to western South Carolina after the
British burned his plantation. The holdouts asked
him his opinion of the situation. &ldquo;Our interests are
the same. With me it is liberty or death,&rdquo; he said.
They elected him their general and went to war.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in South Carolina, other men coalesced
around another former Continental officer, Francis
Marion. Still others followed Elijah Clarke, who
operated along the border between South Carolina
and Georgia. These partisans, seldom numbering
more than 500 men and often as few as 50, struck at
British outposts and supply routes and attacked
groups of loyalists whom the British were arming
and trying to organize into militia regiments. The
British and loyalists grew exasperated. After the
battle of Camden, Lord Cornwallis declared that anyone
who signed a British parole and then switched
sides would be hanged without a trial if captured. If
a man refused to serve in the loyalist militia, he
would be imprisoned and his property confiscated.
At a convention of loyalist militia regiments on
August 23, 1780, the members resolved that these
orders should be ruthlessly applied. They added one
other recommendation. Anyone who refused to serve
in the king&rsquo;s militia should be drafted into the British
regulars, where he would be forced to fight whether
he liked it or not.</p>
<p>For the rest of 1780, a savage seesaw war raged
along the Carolina frontier. Between engagements
both sides exacted retaliation on prisoners and noncombatants.
Elijah Clarke besieged Augusta with a
mixed band of South Carolinians and Georgians.
Forced to retreat by British reinforcements, he left
about two dozen badly wounded men behind. The
loyalist commander of Augusta, Thomas Browne,
wounded in the siege, hanged 13 of them in the
stairwell of his house, where he could watch them
die from his bed. A rebel named Reed was visiting a
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
neighbor&rsquo;s house when the landlady saw two loyalists
approaching. She advised Reed to flee. Reed replied
that they were old friends; he had known them all his
life. He went outside to shake hands. The loyalists
shot him dead. Reed&rsquo;s aged mother rode to a rebel
camp in North Carolina and displayed her son&rsquo;s
bloody pocketbook. The commander of the camp
asked for volunteers. Twenty-five men mounted their
horses, found the murderers, and executed them.</p>
<p>In this sanguinary warfare, the rebels knew the
side roads and forest tracks. They were expert, like
Marion&rsquo;s men, at retreating into swamps. But the
British also had some advantages. The rebels could
do little to prevent retaliation against their homes
and property. If a man went into hiding when the
British or loyalists summoned him to fight in their
militia, all his corn and livestock were liable to
seizure, and his house might even be burned, leaving
his wife and children destitute. This bitter and
discouraging truth became more and more apparent
as the year 1780 waned. Without a Continental army
to back them up, Sumter and the other partisan
leaders found it difficult to persuade men to fight.</p>
<p>Not even the greatest militia victory of the war,
the destruction of a loyalist army of over a thousand
men at Kings Mountain in October 1780, significantly
altered the situation. Although loyalist support
declined, the British army was untouched by
this triumph. Moreover, many of the militiamen in
the rebel army had come from remote valleys deep
in the Appalachians, and they went home immediately,
as militiamen were inclined to do. The men of
western South Carolina were left with the British
regulars still dominating four-fifths of the State, still
ready to exact harsh retaliation against those who
persisted in the rebellion.</p>

Southern frontier in 1780-81.</p>
</div>
<p>George Washington understood the problem. In
an earlier campaign in the north, when the New
Jersey militia failed to turn out, he had said that the
people needed &ldquo;an Army to look the Enemy in the
Face.&rdquo; To replace the disgraced Horatio Gates, he
appointed Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island as the
commander of the Southern army. A 38-year-old
Quaker who walked with a slight limp, Greene had
become Washington&rsquo;s right-hand man in five years of
war in the north. On December 2 he arrived in
Charlotte, N.C., where Horatio Gates was trying to
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
reorganize the remnants of the army shattered at
Camden. Neither the numbers nor the appearance of
the men were encouraging. There were 2,046 soldiers
present and fit for duty. Of these, only 1,173
were Continentals. The rest were militia. Worse, as
Greene told his friend the Marquis de Lafayette, if
he counted as fit for duty only those soldiers who
were properly clothed and equipped, he had fewer
than 800 men and provisions for only three days
in camp. There was scarcely a horse or a wagon in
the army and not a dollar of hard money in the
military chest.</p>
<p>Among Greene&rsquo;s few encouraging discoveries in
the army&rsquo;s camp at Charlotte was the news that
Daniel Morgan had returned to the war and at that
very moment was within 16 miles of the British base
at Camden with a battalion of light infantry and what
was left of the American cavalry under Lt. Col.
William Washington. Angered by Congress&rsquo;s failure
to promote him, Morgan had resigned his colonel&rsquo;s
commission in 1779. The disaster at Camden and the
threat of England&rsquo;s new southern strategy had persuaded
him to forget his personal grievance. Congress
had responded by making him a brigadier general.</p>
<p>Studying his maps, and knowing Morgan&rsquo;s ability
to inspire militia and command light infantry,
Nathanael Greene began to think the Old Wagoner,
as Morgan liked to call himself, was the key to
frustrating British plans to conquer North Carolina.
Lord Cornwallis and the main British army were now
at Winnsborough, S.C., about halfway between the
British base at Camden and their vital back-country
fort at Ninety Six. The British general commanded
3,324 regulars, twice the number of Greene&rsquo;s motley
army, and all presumably well trained and equipped.
Spies and scouts reported the earl was preparing to
invade North Carolina for a winter campaign. North
Carolina had, if anything, more loyalists than South
Carolina. There was grave reason to fear that they
would turn out at the sight of a British army and take
that State out of the shaky American confederacy.</p>
<p>To delay, if not defeat, this potential disaster,
Greene decided to divide his battered army and give
more than half of it to Daniel Morgan. The Old
Wagoner would march swiftly across the front of
Cornwallis&rsquo;s army into western South Carolina and
operate on his left flank and in his rear, threatening
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
the enemy&rsquo;s posts at Ninety Six and Augusta, disrupting
British communications, and&mdash;most important&mdash;encouraging
the militia of western South Carolina to
return to fight. &ldquo;The object of this detachment,&rdquo;
Greene wrote in his instructions to Morgan, &ldquo;is to
give protection to that part of the country and spirit
up the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the army that Joseph McJunkin had
ridden all night to warn. Lord Cornwallis had no
intention of letting Nathanael Greene get away with
this ingenious maneuver. Cornwallis had an answer
to Morgan. His name was Banastre Tarleton.</p>
<h3><b>2</b></h3>
<p>Daniel Morgan might call him &ldquo;Benny.&rdquo; Most
Americans called him &ldquo;the Butcher&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bloody
Tarleton.&rdquo; A thick-shouldered, compact man of middle
height, with bright red hair and a hard mouth, he
was the most feared and hated British soldier in the
South. In 1776 he had come to America, a 21-year-old
cornet&mdash;the British equivalent of a second lieutenant.
He was now a lieutenant colonel, a promotion
so rapid for the British army of the time that it left
older officers frigid with jealousy. Tarleton had
achieved this spectacular rise almost entirely on raw
courage and fierce energy. His father had been a
wealthy merchant and Lord Mayor of Liverpool. He
died while Tarleton was at Oxford, leaving him
&pound;5,000, which the young man promptly gambled and
drank away, while ostensibly studying for the law in
London. He joined the army and discovered he was a
born soldier.</p>
<p>In America, he was a star performer from the start.
In the fall of 1776, while still a cornet, he played a
key role in capturing Maj. Gen. Charles Lee, second
in command of the American army, when he unwisely
spent the night at a tavern in New Jersey,
several miles from his troops. Soon a captain, Tarleton
performed ably for the next two years and in 1778
was appointed a brigade major of the British cavalry.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/i11.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Charles Lee, an English general
retired on half-pay at the
outbreak of the war, threw in
with Americans and received
several important commands
early in the war. His capture
in late 1776 at a New Jersey
tavern by dragoons under
Banastre Tarleton was a
celebrated event.</p>
</div>
<p>Tarleton again distinguished himself when the
British army retreated from Philadelphia to New
York in June 1778. At Monmouth Court House he
began the battle by charging the American advance
column and throwing it into confusion. In New
York, sorting out his troops, the new British commander,
Sir Henry Clinton, rewarded Tarleton with
another promotion. While the British were in Philadelphia,
various loyalists had recruited three troops
of dragoons. In New York, officers&mdash;some loyalist,
some British&mdash;recruited companies of infantry and
more troops of dragoons from different segments of
the loyalist population. One company was Scottish,
two others English, a third American-born. Clinton
combined these fragments into a 550-man unit that
he christened the British Legion. Half cavalry, half
infantry, a legion was designed to operate on the
fringe of a main army as a quick-strike force.
Banastre Tarleton was given command of the British
Legion, which was issued green coats and tan
breeches, unlike other loyalist regiments, who wore
red coats with green facings.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Banastre Tarleton, only 26,
was a short, thick-set, rather
handsome redhead who was
tireless and fearless in battle.
Unlike Morgan, he had been
born to privilege. Scion of a
wealthy Liverpool mercantile
family, he was Oxford educated
and might have become
a barrister except that he
preferred the playing field to
the classroom and the delights
of London theatres and
coffee houses to the study of
law. After squandering a modest
inheritance, he jumped at
the chance to buy a commission
in the King&rsquo;s Dragoons
and serve in America. Eventually
he came into command of
the British Legion, a mounted
and foot unit raised among
American loyalists. Marked by
their distinctive green uniforms,
they soon became
known as Tarleton&rsquo;s Green
Horse. It was their ruthless
ferocity that earned Tarleton
the epithet, &ldquo;Bloody Tarleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the war, Tarleton fell
in love with the beautiful Mary
Robinson, a poet, playwright,
and actress. Tarleton&rsquo;s memoir,
<i>The Campaigns of 1780 and
1781 in the Southern Provinces</i>,
owes much to her
gifted pen.</p>

<p class="pcap">Under Gen. Benjamin Lincoln, the patriots suffered
their worst defeat of the war. Bottled up by Sir Henry Clinton in the peninsula
city of Charleston, he surrendered the entire Continental Army in the South&mdash;more
than 5,000 men&mdash;in May 1780.</p>
</div>
<p>Sailing south with the royal army that besieged
and captured Charleston, Tarleton and his Legion
acted as a mobile screen, protecting the British rear
against attacks by American cavalry and militia from
the interior of the State. The young officer soon
demonstrated a terrifying ability to strike suddenly
and ferociously when the Americans least expected
him. On May 6, 1780, at Lenuds Ferry, he surprised
and virtually destroyed the American cavalry, forcing
William Washington and many other officers and
men to leap into the Santee River to escape him.</p>
<p>After Charleston surrendered, there was only one
unit of regular American troops left in South Carolina,
the 3d Virginia Continentals commanded by
Col. Abraham Buford. He was ordered to retreat to
North Carolina. Cornwallis sent Tarleton and his
Legion in pursuit. Covering 105 miles in 54 hours,
Tarleton caught up with the Americans at Waxhaws.
The 380 Virginians were largely recruits, few of
whom had seen action before. Tarleton and the
Legion charged from front, flank, and rear. Buford
foolishly ordered his men to hold their fire until the
saber-swinging dragoons were on top of them. The
American line was torn to fragments. Buford wheeled
his horse and fled. Tarleton reportedly sabered an
American officer as he tried to raise a white flag.
Other Americans screamed for quarter, but some
kept firing. A bullet killed Tarleton&rsquo;s horse and he
crashed to the ground. This, he later claimed, aroused
his men to a &ldquo;vindictive asperity.&rdquo; They thought
their leader had been killed. Dozens of Americans
were bayonetted or sabered after they had thrown
down their guns and surrendered.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirteen Americans were killed
and 203 captured at Waxhaws. Of the captured, 150
were so badly wounded they were left on the battlefield.
Throughout the Carolinas, the word of the massacre&mdash;which
is what Americans called Waxhaws&mdash;passed
from settlement to settlement. It did not
inspire much trust in British benevolence among
those who were being urged to surrender.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">

<p class="pcap">Tarleton&rsquo;s slaughter of Col.
Abraham Buford&rsquo;s command
at the Waxhaws gave the
patriots a rallying cry&mdash;&ldquo;Tarleton&rsquo;s
quarter&rdquo;&mdash;remembered
to this day.</p>
</div>
<p>After helping to smash the American army at
Camden with another devastating cavalry charge,
Tarleton was ordered to pursue Thomas Sumter and
his partisans. Pushing his men and horses at his usual
pace in spite of the tropical heat of August, he
caught up with Sumter&rsquo;s men at Fishing Creek.
Sabering a few carelessly posted sentries, the British
Legion swept down on the Carolinians as they lay
about their camp, their arms stacked, half of them
sleeping or cooking. Sumter leaped on a bareback
horse and imitated Buford, fleeing for his life. Virtually
the entire American force of more than 400
men was killed or captured. When the news was published
in England, Tarleton became a national hero.
In his official dispatches, Cornwallis called him &ldquo;one
of the most promising officers I ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sumter immediately began gathering a new
force and Francis Marion and his raiders repeatedly
emerged from the lowland swamps to harass communications
with Charleston and punish any loyalist
who declared for the king. Tarleton did not understand
this stubborn resistance and liked it even less.
A nauseating bout with yellow fever deepened his
saturnine mood. Pursuing Marion along the Santee
and Black Rivers, Tarleton ruthlessly burned the
farmhouses of &ldquo;violent rebels,&rdquo; as he called them.
&ldquo;The country is now convinced of the error of the
insurrection,&rdquo; he wrote to Cornwallis. But Tarleton
failed to catch &ldquo;the damned old fox,&rdquo; Marion.</p>
<p>The British Legion had scarcely returned from
this exhausting march when they were ordered out
once more in pursuit of Sumter. On November 9,
1780, with a new band of partisans, Sumter fought
part of the British 63d Regiment, backed by a troop
of Legion dragoons, at Fishdam Ford on the Broad
River and mauled them badly. &ldquo;I wish you would get
three Legions, and divide yourself in three parts,&rdquo;
Cornwallis wrote Tarleton. &ldquo;We can do no good
without you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Once more the Legion marched for the back
country. As usual, Tarleton&rsquo;s pace was almost supernaturally
swift. On November 20, 1780, he caught
Sumter and his men as they were preparing to ford
the Tyger River. But this time Tarleton&rsquo;s fondness
for headlong pursuit got him into serious trouble. He
had left most of his infantry far behind him and
pushed ahead with less than 200 cavalry and 90
infantry, riding two to a horse. Sumter had close to a
thousand men and he attacked, backwoods style,
filtering through the trees to pick off foot soldiers
and horsemen. Tarleton ordered a bayonet charge.
The infantry was so badly shot up, Tarleton had to
charge with the cavalry to extricate them, exposing
his dragoon to deadly rifle fire from other militiamen
entrenched in a log tobacco house known as Blackstocks.
The battle ended in a bloody draw. Sumter
was badly wounded and his men abandoned the field
to the green-coated dragoons, slipping across the
Tyger in the darkness. Without their charismatic
leader, Sumter&rsquo;s militia went home.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">

<p class="pcap">This portrait of Tarleton and

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sumter is defeated,&rdquo; Tarleton reported to Cornwallis,
&ldquo;his corps dispersed. But my Lord I have lost
men&mdash;50 killed and wounded.&rdquo; The war was becoming
more and more disheartening to Tarleton. Deepening
his black mood was news from home. His
older brother had put him up for Parliament from
Liverpool. The voters had rejected him. They admired
his courage, but the American war was no
longer popular in England.</p>
<p>While Cornwallis remained at Winnsborough,
Tarleton returned from Blackstocks and camped at
various plantations south of the Broad River. During
his projected invasion of North Carolina, Cornwallis
expected Tarleton and his Legion to keep the dwindling
rebels of South Carolina dispersed to their
homes. Thus the British commander would have no
worries about the British base at Ninety Six, the key
to the back country. The fort and surrounding
settlement had been named by an early mapmaker in
the course of measuring distances on the Cherokee
Path, an ancient Indian route from the mountains to
the ocean. The district around Ninety Six was the
breadbasket of South Carolina; it was also heavily
loyalist. But a year of partisan warfare had made
their morale precarious. The American-born commander
of the fort, Col. John Harris Cruger, had
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
recently warned Cornwallis that the loyalists &ldquo;were
wearied by the long continuance of the campaign ...
and the whole district had determined to submit as
soon as the rebels should enter it.&rdquo; The mere hint of
a threat to Ninety Six and the order it preserved in its
vicinity was enough to send flutters of alarm through
British headquarters.</p>
<p>There were flutters aplenty when Cornwallis heard
from spies that Daniel Morgan had crossed the
Broad River and was marching on Ninety Six. Simultaneously
came news that William Washington, the
commander of Morgan&rsquo;s cavalry, had routed a group
of loyalists at Hammonds Store and forced another
group to abandon a fort not far from Ninety Six. At
5 a.m. on January 2, Lt. Henry Haldane, one of Cornwallis&rsquo;s
aides, rode into Tarleton&rsquo;s camp and told him
the news. Close behind Haldane came a messenger
with a letter from Cornwallis: &ldquo;If Morgan is ...
anywhere within your reach, I should wish you to
push him to the utmost.&rdquo; Haldane rushed an order to
Maj. Archibald McArthur, commander of the first
battalion of the 71st Regiment, which was not far
away, guarding a ford over the Broad River that
guaranteed quick communication with Ninety Six.
McArthur was to place his men under Tarleton&rsquo;s
command and join him in a forced march to rescue
the crucial fort.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/i15.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="795" />
<p class="pcap">The little village of Ninety
Six was a center of loyalist
sentiment in the Carolina
backcountry. Cornwallis mistakenly
thought Morgan had
designs on it and therefore
sent Tarleton in pursuit,
bringing on the battle of
Cowpens. This map diagrams
the siege that Gen.
Nathanael Greene mounted
against the post in May-June
of 1781.</p>
</div>
<p>Tarleton obeyed with his usual speed. His dragoons
ranged far ahead of his little army, which now
numbered about 700 men. By the end of the day he
concluded that there was no cause for alarm about
Ninety Six. Morgan was nowhere near it. But his
scouts reported that Morgan was definitely south of
the Broad River, urging militia from North and
South Carolina to join him.</p>
<p>Tarleton&rsquo;s response to this challenge was almost
inevitable. He asked Cornwallis for permission to
pursue Morgan and either destroy him or force him
to retreat over the Broad River again. There, Cornwallis
and his army could devour him.</p>
<p>The young cavalry commander outlined the operation
in a letter to Cornwallis on January 4. He
realized that he was all but giving orders to his general,
and tactfully added: &ldquo;I feel myself bold in offering
my opinion [but] it flows from zeal for the public
service and well grounded enquiry concerning the
enemy&rsquo;s designs and operations.&rdquo; If Cornwallis approved
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the plan, Tarleton asked for reinforcements:
a troop of cavalry from the 17th Light Dragoons and
the infantrymen of the 7th Regiment of Royal Fusiliers,
who were marching from Camden to reinforce
Ninety Six.</p>
<p>Cornwallis approved the plan, including the reinforcements.
As soon as they arrived, Tarleton began
his march. January rain poured down, swelling every
creek, turning the roads into quagmires. Cornwallis,
with his larger army and heavy baggage train, began
a slow advance up the east bank of the Broad River.
As the commander in chief, he had more to worry
about than Tarleton. Behind him was another British
general, Sir Alexander Leslie, with 1,500 reinforcements.
Cornwallis feared that Greene or Marion
might strike a blow at them. The earl assumed that
Tarleton was as mired by the rain and blocked by
swollen watercourses as he was. On January 12, Cornwallis
wrote to Leslie, who was being delayed by
even worse mud in the lowlands: &ldquo;I believe Tarleton
is as much embarrassed with the waters as you are.&rdquo;
The same day, Cornwallis reported to another officer,
the commander in occupied Charleston: &ldquo;The
rains have put a total stop to Tarleton and Leslie.&rdquo;
On this assumption, Cornwallis decided to halt and
wait for Leslie to reach him.</p>
<p>Tarleton had not allowed the August heat of South
Carolina to slow his pace. He was equally contemptuous
of the January rains. His scouts reported that
Morgan&rsquo;s army was at Grindal Shoals on the Pacolet
River. To reach the patriots he had to cross two
smaller but equally swollen streams, the Enoree and
the Tyger. Swimming his horses, floating his infantry
across on improvised rafts, he surmounted these
obstacles and headed northeast, deep into the South
Carolina back country. He did not realize that his
column, which now numbered over a thousand men,
was becoming more and more isolated. He assumed
that Cornwallis was keeping pace with him on the
east side of the Broad River, cowing the rebel militia
there into staying home.</p>

matter how swiftly he advanced, he was not going to
take the patriots by surprise. He was being watched

<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h3><b>3</b></h3>
<p><i>Skyagunsta</i>, the Wizard Owl, was what the
Cherokees called 41-year-old Andrew Pickens. They
both feared and honored him as a battle leader who
had defeated them repeatedly on their home grounds.
Born in Pennsylvania, Pickens had come to South
Carolina as a boy. In 1765 he had married the
beautiful Rebecca Calhoun and settled on Long
Canes Creek in the Ninety Six district. Pickens was
no speechmaker, but everyone recognized this slender
man, who was just under 6 feet tall, as a leader.
When he spoke, people listened. One acquaintance
declared that he was so deliberate, he seemed at
times to take each word out of his mouth and
examine it before he said it. Pickens had been one of
the leaders who repelled the British-inspired assaults
on the back country by the Cherokee Indians in 1776
and carried the war into the red men&rsquo;s country,
forcing them to plead for peace. By 1779 he was a
colonel commanding one of the most dependable
militia regiments in the State. When the loyalists,
encouraged by the British conquest of Georgia in
1778-79, began to gather and plot to punish their
rebel neighbors, Pickens led 400 men to assault them
at Kettle Creek on the Savannah River. In a fierce,
hour-long fight, he whipped them although they
outnumbered him almost two to one.</p>
<p>After Charleston surrendered, Pickens&rsquo; military
superior in the Ninety Six district, Brig. Gen. Andrew
Williamson, was the only high-ranking official left in
South Carolina. The governor John Rutledge had fled
to North Carolina, the legislature had dispersed, the
courts had collapsed. Early in June 1780, Williamson
called together his officers and asked them to vote
on whether they should continue to resist. Only eight
officers opposed immediate surrender. In Pickens&rsquo;
own regiment only two officers and four enlisted
men favored resistance. The rest saw no hope of
stopping the British regular army advancing toward
them from Charleston. Without a regular army of
their own to match the British, they could envision
only destruction of their homes and desolation for
their families if they resisted.</p>
<p>Andrew Pickens was among these realists who had
accepted the surrender terms offered by the British.
At his command, his regiment of 300 men stacked
their guns at Ninety Six and went home. As Pickens
understood the terms, he and his men were paroled
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
on their promise not to bear arms against the king.
They became neutrals. The British commander of
Ninety Six, Colonel Cruger, seemed to respect this
opinion. Cruger treated Pickens with great deference.
The motive for this delicate treatment became visible
in a letter Cruger sent Cornwallis on November 27.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is more than a possibility of getting a
certain person in the Long Canes settlement to
accept of a command,&rdquo; Cruger wrote. &ldquo;And then I
should most humbly be of opinion that every man in
the country would declare and act for His Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a tribute to Pickens&rsquo; influence as a leader.
He was also a man of his word. Even when Sumter,
Clarke, and other partisan leaders demonstrated
that there were many men in South Carolina ready
to keep fighting, Pickens remained peaceably at
home on his plantation at Long Canes. Tales of
Tarleton&rsquo;s cruelty at Waxhaws, of British and loyalist
vindictiveness in other districts of the State undoubtedly
reached him. But no acts of injustice had been
committed against him or his men. The British were
keeping their part of the bargain and he would keep
his part.</p>
<p>Then Cornwallis&rsquo;s aide, Haldane, appeared at
Ninety Six and summoned Pickens. He offered him a
colonel&rsquo;s commission in the royal militia and a
promise of protection. There were also polite hints
of the possibility of a monetary reward for switching
sides. Pickens agreed to ride down to Charleston and
talk over the whole thing with the British commander
there. The visit was delayed by partisan warfare in
the Ninety Six district, stirred by the arrival of
Nathanael Greene to take command of the remnant
of the American regular army in Charlotte. Greene
urged the wounded Sumter and the Georgian Clarke
to embody their men and launch a new campaign.
Sumter urged Pickens to break his parole, call out
his regiment, and march with him to join Greene.
Pickens refused to leave Long Canes.</p>

Clarke led a band of Georgians and South Carolinians
to the outskirts of Long Canes, on their
march to join Greene. Many men from Pickens&rsquo; old
regiment broke their paroles and joined them. Clarke
ordered Maj. James McCall, one of Pickens&rsquo; favorite
officers and one of two who had refused to surrender
at Ninety Six, to kidnap Pickens and bring him
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
before an improvised court-martial board. Accused
of preparing to join the loyalists, Pickens calmly
admitted that the British were making him offers. So
far he had refused them. Even if former friends
made good on their threat to court-martial and hang
him, he could not break his pledged word of honor
to remain neutral.</p>
<p>The frustrated Georgians and South Carolinians
let Pickens go home. On December 12, Cruger sent a
detachment of regulars and loyalist militia to attack
the interlopers. The royalists surprised the rebels
and routed them, wounding Clarke and McCall and
scattering the survivors. Most of the Georgians
drifted back to their home state and the Carolinians
straggled toward Greene in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The battle had a profound effect on Andrew
Pickens. Friends, former comrades-in-arms, had been
wounded, humiliated. He still hesitated to take the
final step and break his parole. His strict Presbyterian
conscience, his soldier&rsquo;s sense of honor, would not
permit it. But he went to Ninety Six and told Colonel
Cruger that he could not accept a commission in the
royal militia. Cruger sighed and revealed what he
had been planning to do since he started wooing
Pickens. In a few days, on orders from Cornwallis,
the loyalist colonel was going to publish a proclamation
which would permit no one to remain neutral. It
would require everyone around Ninety Six to come
to the fort, swear allegiance to the king, and enlist in
the royal militia.</p>
<p>Pickens said his conscience would not permit him
to do this. If the British threatened him with punishment
for his refusal, it would be a violation of his
parole and he would consider himself free to join the
rebels. One British officer, who had become a friend
and admirer of the resolute Pickens, warned him:
&ldquo;You will campaign with a halter around your neck.
If we catch you, we will hang you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pickens decided to take the risk. He rode about
Long Canes calling out his regiment. The response
was somewhat discouraging. Only about 70 men
turned out. Coordinating their movements with Colonel
Washington&rsquo;s raid on the loyalists at Hammonds
Store, they joined the patriot cavalry and rode past
Ninety Six to Morgan&rsquo;s camp on the Pacolet.</p>
<p>The numbers Pickens brought with him were
disappointing. But he and his men knew the back
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
country intimately. They were the eyes and ears
Morgan&rsquo;s little army desperately needed. Morgan
immediately asked Pickens to advance to a position
about midway between Fair Forest Creek and the
Tyger River and send his horsemen ranging out from
that point in all directions to guard against a surprise
attack by Banastre Tarleton.</p>
<p>The Wizard Owl and his men mounted their horses
and rode away to begin their reconnaissance. General
Morgan soon knew enough about the enemy
force coming after him to make him fear for his
army&rsquo;s survival.</p>
<h3><b>4</b></h3>
<p>Daniel Morgan might call Banastre Tarleton
&ldquo;Benny&rdquo; for the entertainment of young militiamen
like Joseph McJunkin. But Morgan had been fighting
the British for five years. He was as close to being a
professional soldier as any American of his time. He
knew Banastre Tarleton was no joke. In fact, the
casual style of his decision to reunite his cavalry and
infantry at the Thompson plantation on Thicketty
Creek disguised a decision to retreat. The march to
Thicketty Creek put an additional 10 miles between
him and the aggressive British cavalryman. Behind
the mask of easy confidence Morgan wore for his
men, there was a very worried general.</p>
<p>As soon as he crossed the Broad River and
camped at Grindal Shoals on the north bank of the
Pacolet on December 25, 1780, Morgan began sending
messengers to the men of western Georgia,
South Carolina, and North Carolina, urging them to
turn out and support him. The response had been
disheartening. Pickens, as we have seen, was unable
to muster more than a fraction of his old regiment.
From Georgia came only a small detachment of
about 100 men under the command of Lt. Col. James
Jackson and Maj. John Cunningham. Because their
leader Elijah Clarke was out of action from his
wound at Long Canes, the Georgians were inclined
to stay home. Sumter, though almost recovered from
his wound, sulked on the east side of the Broad River.
He felt Greene had sent Morgan into his sphere of
command without properly consulting him.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Arms and Tactics</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The armies fought the way
they did&mdash;on open ground in
long lines of musket-wielding
infantry standing two and three
ranks deep&mdash;because that was
the most rational way to use
the weapons they had.</p>
<p>The main weapon of this
combat was the muzzle-loading,
smooth-bore, flint-lock
musket, equipped with a 16-inch
bayonet. It hurled a
one-ounce lead ball of .70 to
.80 calibre fairly accurately up
to 75 yards, but distance
scarcely mattered. The object
was to break up the enemy&rsquo;s
formations with volleys and
then rout them with cold steel.
The British were masters of
these linear tactics, and Washington
and his commanders
spent the war trying to instill
the same discipline in their
Continentals so that they could
stand up to redcoats on equal
terms in battle.</p>
<p>The American rifle was not
the significant weapon legend
later made it out to be.
Though accurate at great distances,
it was slow to load and
useless in open battle because
it was not equipped
with a bayonet. But in the
hands of skirmishers the rifle
could do great damage, as the
British found out at Cowpens.</p>

<p>Morgan&rsquo;s highest hopes had been focused on
North Carolina, which had thus far been relatively
untouched by the British. The commander of the
militia in the back country was Brig. Gen. William
Davidson, a former Continental officer whom
Morgan had known at Valley Forge. An energetic,
committed man, popular with the militia, Davidson
had been expected to muster from 600 to 1,000 men.
Instead, Morgan got a letter from him with the
doleful report: &ldquo;I have not ninety men.&rdquo; An Indian
incursion on the western frontier had drawn off
many of the militia and inclined others to stay home
to protect their families. On December 28, Davidson
rode into Morgan&rsquo;s camp with only 120 men. He said
that he hoped to have another 500 mustered at
Salisbury in the next week and rode off to find them,
leaving Morgan muttering in dismay.</p>
<p>Morgan had eagerly accepted this independent
command because he thought at least 2,500 militiamen
would join his 500 Continentals and Virginia
six-months men. With an army that size, he could
have besieged or even stormed the British stronghold
at Ninety Six. His present force seemed too
small to do the enemy any damage. But it was large
enough to give its commander numerous headaches.
In addition to the major worry of annihilation by the
enemy, food was scarce. The country along the
Pacolet had been plundered and fought over for so
long, there was nothing left to requisition from the
farms. On December 31, in a letter to Greene,
Morgan predicted that in a few days supplies would
be &ldquo;unattainable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What to do? The only practical move he could see
for his feeble army was a march into Georgia. The
British outpost at Augusta was weaker and more
isolated than Ninety Six. Even here, Morgan was
cautious. &ldquo;I have consulted with General Davidson
and Colonel Pickens whether we could secure a safe
retreat, should we be pushed by a superior force.
They tell me it can be easily effected,&rdquo; he wrote
Greene, asking his approval of this plan.</p>
<p>Morgan was reluctant to advance beyond the
Pacolet. The reason was rooted in his keen understanding
of the psychology of the average militiaman.
He wanted to come out, fight and go home as
soon as possible. He did not want to fight if the
regular army that was supposed to look the enemy in
the face seemed more interested in showing the
enemy their backs. &ldquo;Were we to advance, and be
constrained to retreat, the consequences would be
very disagreeable,&rdquo; Morgan told Greene, speaking
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
as one general to another. The militia, he was saying,
would go home.</p>
<p>Greene was equally anxious about Morgan. Writing
from Cheraw Hills on the Pee Dee River on
December 29, the southern commander told Morgan
of the arrival of Gen. Alexander Leslie in Charleston
with reinforcements. This news meant the British
would almost certainly advance soon. &ldquo;Watch their
motions very narrowly and take care to guard against
a surprise,&rdquo; he wrote. A week later, in another letter,
he repeated the warning. &ldquo;The enemy and the Tories
both will try to bring you into disgrace ... to prevent
your influence upon the militia, especially the weak
and wavering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greene vetoed Morgan&rsquo;s expedition into Georgia.
He did not think Morgan was strong enough to
accomplish much. &ldquo;The enemy ... secure in their
fortifications, will take no notice of your movement,&rdquo;
he predicted. Greene was persuaded that
Cornwallis would strike at his half of the army in
their camp at Cheraw Hills, and he did not want
Morgan in Georgia if this threat materialized. Ignoring
Morgan&rsquo;s worries about feeding his men, Greene
told him to stay where he was, on the Pacolet or &ldquo;in
the neighborhood,&rdquo; and await an opportunity to
attack the British rear when they marched into
North Carolina.</p>
<p>Morgan replied with a lament. He reiterated his
warning that &ldquo;forage [for the horses] and provisions
are not to be had.&rdquo; He insisted there was &ldquo;but one
alternative, either to retreat or move into Georgia.&rdquo;
A retreat, he warned, &ldquo;will be attended with the
most fatal consequences. The spirit which now
begins to pervade the people and call them into the
field, will be destroyed. The militia who have already
joined will desert us and it is not improbable
but that a regard for their own safety will induce
them to join the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last line is grim evidence of the power of the
British policy of forcing everyone to serve in the
loyalist militia. But Nathanael Greene remained
adamant. He reported to Morgan more bad news,
which made a march into Georgia even more inadvisable.
Another British general, with 2,500 men, had
landed in Virginia and was attacking that vital State,
upon which the southern army depended for much
of its supplies. It made no sense to send some of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
army&rsquo;s best troops deeper into the South, when Virginia
might call on Greene and Morgan for aid. Almost
casually Greene added: &ldquo;Col. Tarleton is said to
be on his way to pay you a visit. I doubt not but he will
have a decent reception and a proper dismission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a strange remark for a worried general to
make. From other letters Greene wrote around this
time, it is evident that he had received a number of
conflicting reports about Tarleton&rsquo;s strength and
position. The American commander was also unsure
about British intentions. He assumed that Cornwallis
and Tarleton were moving up the opposite sides of
the Broad River in concert. Since the main British
column under Cornwallis had all but stopped advancing,
Greene assumed Tarleton had stopped too
and that Morgan was in no immediate danger.</p>
<p>Around this time, a man who had known Daniel
Morgan as a boy in Virginia visited his camp.
Richard Winn, after whom Winnsborough was
named&mdash;and whose mansion Cornwallis was using as
his headquarters&mdash;discussed Tarleton&rsquo;s tactics with
his old friend. Winn told Morgan that Tarleton&rsquo;s
favorite mode of fighting was by surprise. &ldquo;He never
brings on [leads] his attacks himself,&rdquo; Winn said. He
prefers to send in two or three troops of horse,
&ldquo;whose goal is to throw the other party into confusion.
Then Tarleton attacks with his reserve and cuts
them to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much as he dreaded the thought of a retreat,
Morgan was too experienced a soldier not to prepare
for one. He sent his quartermaster across the Broad
River with orders to set up magazines of supplies for
his army. This officer returned with dismaying news.
General Sumter had refused to cooperate with this
request and directed his subordinates to obey no
orders from Morgan.</p>
<p>Adding to Morgan&rsquo;s supply woes was a Carolina
military custom. Every militiaman brought his horse
to camp with him. This meant that Morgan had to
find forage for over 450 horses (counting William
Washington&rsquo;s cavalry), each of whom ate 25 to 30
pounds of oats and hay a day. &ldquo;Could the militia be
persuaded to change their fatal mode of going to
war,&rdquo; Morgan groaned to Greene, &ldquo;much provision
might be saved; but the custom has taken such deep
root that it cannot be abolished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bands of militiamen constantly left the army to
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
hunt for forage. This practice made it impossible for
Morgan to know how many men he had in his
command. In desperation, he ordered his officers,
both Continental and militia, to call the roll every
two hours. This measure only gave him more bad
news. On January 15, after retreating from the
Pacolet to Thicketty Creek, he reported to Greene
that he had only 340 militia with him, but did not
expect &ldquo;to have more than two-thirds of these to
assist me, should I be attacked, for it is impossible to
keep them collected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making Morgan feel even more like a military Job
was a personal problem. The incessant rain and the
damp January cold had awakened an illness that he
had contracted fighting in Canada during the winter
of 1775-76, a rheumatic inflammation of the sciatic
nerve in his hip. It made riding a horse agony for
Morgan.</p>
<p>In his tent on Thicketty Creek, where he had
rendezvoused with William Washington and his 80
cavalrymen, who had been getting their horses shod
at Wofford&rsquo;s iron works, Morgan all but abandoned
any hope of executing the mission on which Greene
had sent him. &ldquo;My force is inadequate,&rdquo; he wrote.
&ldquo;Upon a full and mature deliberation I am confirmed
in the opinion that nothing can be effected by
my detachment in this country, which will balance
the risks I will be subjected to by remaining here.
The enemy&rsquo;s great superiority in numbers and our
distance from the main army, will enable Lord
Cornwallis to detach so superior a force against me,
as to render it essential to our safety to avoid coming
to action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be best, Morgan told Greene, if he were
recalled with his little band of Continentals and
Andrew Pickens or William Davidson left to command
the back-country militia. Without the regulars
to challenge them, the British were less likely to
invade the district and under Pickens&rsquo; leadership the
rebels would be able to keep &ldquo;a check on the
disaffected&rdquo;&mdash;the Tories&mdash;&ldquo;which,&rdquo; Morgan added
mournfully, &ldquo;is all I can effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he wrote these words on January 15, Morgan
was still unaware of what was coming at him. From
the reports of Pickens&rsquo; scouts, he had begun to worry
that Tarleton might have more than his 550-man
British Legion with him. With the help of Washington&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
cavalry, he felt confident that he could beat off
an attack by the Legion. But what if Tarleton had
additional men? &ldquo;Col. Tarleton has crossed the
Tyger at Musgrove&rsquo;s Mill,&rdquo; Morgan told Greene.
&ldquo;His force we cannot learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into Morgan&rsquo;s camp galloped more scouts from
Pickens. They brought news that Morgan made the
last sentence of his letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have just learned that Tarleton&rsquo;s force is from
eleven to twelve hundred British.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last word was the significant one. <i>British.</i>
Twelve hundred regulars, trained troops, saber-swinging
dragoons and bayonet-wielding infantry
like the men who had sent the militia running for
their lives at Camden and then cut the Continentals
to pieces. Gen. Daniel Morgan could see only one
alternative&mdash;retreat.</p>
<h3><b>5</b></h3>
<p>Until he got this information on the numbers
and composition of Tarleton&rsquo;s army, Morgan seems
to have toyed with the possibility of ambushing the
British as they crossed the Pacolet. He left strong
detachments of his army at the most likely fords. At
the very least, he may have wanted to make the
crossing a bloody business for the British, perhaps
killing some of their best officers, even Tarleton
himself. If he could repulse or delay Tarleton at the
river, Morgan hoped he could gain enough time to
retreat to a ford across the upper Broad, well out of
reach of Cornwallis on the other side of the river.
Pickens had kept Morgan well informed of the
sluggish advance of the main British army. He knew
they were far to the south, a good 30 miles behind
Tarleton.</p>
<p>North of the Broad, Morgan reasoned they could
be easily joined by the 500 North Carolina militia
William Davidson had promised him as well as South
Carolina men from that district. If Tarleton continued
the pursuit, they could give battle on the rugged
slopes of Kings Mountain, where the cavalry of the
British Legion would be useless.</p>
<p>Morgan undoubtedly discussed this plan with the
leaders of the militiamen who were already with
him&mdash;Joseph McDowell of North Carolina, whose
men had fought at Kings Mountain, James Jackson
and John Cunningham of Georgia, James McCall,
Thomas Brandon, William Bratton and other South
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Carolinians, perhaps also Andrew Pickens. They did
not have much enthusiasm for it. They warned
Morgan that at least half the militia, especially the
South Carolinians, would be inclined to go home
rather than retreat across the Broad. In the back
country, men perceived rivers as dividing lines between
districts. Most of the South Carolina men in
camp came from the west side of the Broad. Moreover,
with Sumter hostile, there was no guarantee
that they would be able to persuade many men on
the other side of the river to join them.</p>
<p>In this discussion, it seems likely that these militia
leaders mentioned the Cowpens as a good place to
fight Tarleton on the south side of the river. The
grazing ground was a name familiar to everyone in
the back country. It was where the militia had
assembled before the battle of Kings Mountain the
previous fall. Messengers could be sent into every
district within a day&rsquo;s ride to urge laggards to join
them there.</p>
<p>Morgan mulled this advice while his men guarded
the fords of the Pacolet. As dusk fell on January 15,
Tarleton and his army appeared on the south bank of
the river. He saw the guards and wheeled, marching
up the stream toward a ford near Wofford&rsquo;s iron
works. On the opposite bank, Morgan&rsquo;s men kept
pace with him, step for step. Then, with no warning,
the British disappeared into the night. Retreating?
Making camp? No one knew. It was too risky to
venture across the swollen river to follow him. The
British Legion cavalry always guarded Tarleton&rsquo;s
flanks and rear.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, a militia detachment
miles down the river in the opposite direction made
an alarming discovery. Tarleton was across! He had
doubled back in the dark and marched most of the
night to cross at Easterwood Shoals. He was only
6 miles from Morgan&rsquo;s camp on Thicketty Creek.
Leaping on their horses, the guards galloped to
Morgan with the news.</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s men were cooking breakfast. Out of his
tent charged the general to roar orders at them, the
wagoners, the infantry, the cavalrymen. Prepare to
march immediately! The men grabbed their half-cooked
cornmeal cakes and stuffed them into their
mouths. The militia and the cavalry ran for their
horses, the wagoners hitched their teams, the Continentals
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
formed ranks, and the column got underway.
Morgan pressed forward, ignoring the pain in his
hip, demanding more and more speed from his men.
He headed northwest, toward Cowpens, on the
Green River Road, a route that would also take him
to the Island Ford across the Broad River, about
6 miles beyond Cowpens.</p>
<p>All day the men slogged along the slick, gooey
roads, Morgan at the head of the column setting a
relentless pace. His sciatic hip tormented him. Behind
him, the militiamen were expending &ldquo;many a
hearty curse&rdquo; on him, one of them later recalled. As
Nathanael Greene wryly remarked, in the militia
every man considered himself a general.</p>
<p>But Daniel Morgan was responsible for their lives
and the lives of his Continentals, some of whom had
marched doggedly from battlefield to battlefield for
over four years. In the company of the Delaware
Continentals who served beside the Marylanders in
the light infantry brigade, there was a lieutenant
named Thomas Anderson who kept track of the
miles he had marched since they headed south in
May 1780. At the end of each day he entered in his
journal the ever-growing total. By January 16, it was
1,435. No matter what the militia thought of him,
Daniel Morgan was not going to throw away such
men in a battle simply to prove his courage.</p>
<p>Seldom has there been a better example of the
difference between the professional and the amateur
soldier. In his letters urging militiamen to join him,
Morgan had warned them against the futility of
fighting in such small detachments. He had asked
them to come into his camp and subject themselves
to &ldquo;order and discipline ... so that I may be enabled
to direct you ... to the advantage of the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same letters, Morgan had made a promise
to these men. &ldquo;I will ask you to encounter no
dangers or difficulties, but what I shall participate
in.&rdquo; If he retreated across the Broad, he would be
exposing the men who refused to go with him to
Tarleton&rsquo;s policy of extermination by fire and sword.
If they went with him, their families, their friends,
their homes would be abandoned to the young
lieutenant colonel&rsquo;s vengeance.</p>
<p>This conflict between prudence and his promise
must have raged in Morgan&rsquo;s mind as his army toiled
along the Green River Road. It was hard marching.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
The road dipped into hollows and looped around
small hills. Swollen creeks cut across it. The woods
were thick on both sides of it. At dusk, the Americans
emerged from the forest onto a flat, lightly
wooded tableland. At least, it looked flat at first
glance. As Morgan led his men into it, he noted that
the ground rose gradually to a slight crest, then
dipped and rose to another slightly higher crest. Oak
and hickory trees were dotted throughout the more
or less rectangular area, but there was practically no
underbrush. This was the Cowpens, a place where
back-country people pastured their cattle and prepared
them to be driven to market.</p>
<p>In the distance, Morgan could see the Blue Ridge
Mountains, which rise from the flat country beyond
the Broad like a great rampart. They were 30 miles
away. If they could reach them, the army was safe.
But militia scouts brought in grim news. The river
was rising. It would be a difficult business crossing at
Island Ford in the dark. The ford was still 6 miles
away, and the men were exhausted from their all-day
march. If they rested at Cowpens and tried to cross
the river the next morning, Banastre Tarleton, that
soldier who liked to march by night, would be upon
them, ready to slash them to pieces.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was that report which helped Morgan
make his decision. One suspects he almost welcomed
the news that the army was, for all practical
purposes, trapped and fighting was the only alternative.
There was enough of the citizen-soldier in
Morgan to dislike retreating almost as much as the
average militiaman.</p>
<p>The more Morgan studied the terrain around him,
the more he liked it. The militia leaders were right.
This was the best place to fight Tarleton. Sitting on
his horse, looking down the slope to the Green River
Road, Morgan noted the way the land fell off to the
left and right toward several creeks. The Cowpens
was bordered by marshy ground that would make it
difficult for Tarleton to execute any sweeping flank
movements with his cavalry. As his friend Richard
Winn had told him, that was not Tarleton&rsquo;s style,
anyway. He was more likely to come straight at the
Americans with his infantry and cavalry in a headlong
charge. Experience told Morgan there were
ways to handle such an assault&mdash;tactics that 26-year-old
Banastre Tarleton had probably never seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Now the important thing was to communicate the
will to fight. Turning to his officers, Morgan said,
&ldquo;On this ground I will beat Benny Tarleton or I will
lay my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><b>6</b></h3>
<p><i>Eleven to twelve hundred British</i>, Daniel Morgan
had written. Ironically, as Morgan ordered
another retreat from this formidable foe, the British
were barricading themselves in some log houses on
the north bank of the Pacolet River, expecting an
imminent attack from the patriots. Their spies had
told them that Morgan had 3,000 men, and Tarleton
was taking no chances. After seizing this strong
point, only a few miles below Morgan&rsquo;s camp, he
sent out a cavalry patrol. They soon reported that
the Americans had &ldquo;decamped.&rdquo; Tarleton immediately
advanced to Morgan&rsquo;s abandoned campsite,
where his hungry soldiers were delighted to find
&ldquo;plenty of provisions which they had left behind
them, half cooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing stirred Banastre Tarleton&rsquo;s blood more
than a retreating enemy. British soldiers, famed for
their tenacity in war, have often been compared to
the bulldog. But Tarleton was more like the bloodhound.
A fleeing foe meant the chance of an easy
victory. It was not only instinct, it was part of his
training as a cavalryman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patrols and spies were immediately dispatched to
observe the Americans,&rdquo; Tarleton later recalled.
The British Legion dragoons were ordered to follow
Morgan until dark. Then the job was turned over to
&ldquo;other emissaries&rdquo;&mdash;loyalists. Tarleton had about 50
with him to act as scouts and spies. Early that
evening, January 16, probably around the time that
Morgan was deciding to fight at Cowpens, a party of
loyalists brought in a militia colonel who had wandered
out of the American line of march, perhaps in
search of forage for his horse. Threatened with
instant hanging, the man talked. He told Tarleton
that Morgan hoped to stop at Cowpens and gather
more militia. But the captive said that Morgan then
intended to get across the Broad River, where he
thought he would be safe.</p>
<p>The information whetted Tarleton&rsquo;s appetite. It
seemed obvious to him that he should &ldquo;hang upon
General Morgan&rsquo;s rear&rdquo; to cut off any militia reinforcements
that might show up. If Morgan tried to
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
cross the Broad, Tarleton would be in a position to
&ldquo;perplex his design,&rdquo; as he put it&mdash;a stuffy way of
saying he could cut him to pieces. Around midnight,
other loyalist scouts brought in a rumor of more
American reinforcements on their way&mdash;a &ldquo;corps of
mountaineers.&rdquo; This sent a chill through the British,
even through Tarleton. It sounded like the return of
the mountain men who had helped destroy the loyalist
army at Kings Mountain. It became more and
more obvious to Tarleton that he should attack
Morgan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>About three in the morning of the 17th of January,
Tarleton called in his sentries and ordered his drummers
to rouse his men. Leaving 35 baggage wagons
and 70 Negro slaves with a 100-man guard commanded
by a lieutenant, he marched his sleepy men
down the rutted Green River Road, the same route
Morgan had followed the previous day. The British
found the marching hard in the dark. The ground,
Tarleton later wrote, was &ldquo;broken, and much intersected
by creeks and ravines.&rdquo; Ahead of the column
and on both flanks scouts prowled the woods to
prevent an ambush.</p>
<p>Describing the march, Tarleton also gave a precise
description of his army. Three companies of light
infantry, supported by the infantry of the British
Legion, formed his vanguard. The light infantry
were all crack troops, most of whom had been fighting
in America since the beginning of the war. One
company was from the 16th Regiment and had participated
in some of the swift, surprise attacks for
which light infantry was designed. They had been
part of the British force that killed and wounded 150
Americans in a night assault at Paoli, Pa., in the fall
of 1777. The light company of the 71st Regiment had
a similar record, having also been part of the light
infantry brigade that the British organized early in
the war.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/i18.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="522" />
<p class="pcap">Music made the soldier&rsquo;s life
more tolerable on the march
and in camp. But the most
important use was in battle.
Both the drum and the fife
conveyed signals and orders
over the din and confusion
far better than the human
voice. This iron fife is an
original 18th-century instrument.
The drum, according
to tradition, was carried in
the war.</p>
</div>
<p>With these regulars marched another company of
light infantry whose memories were not so grand&mdash;the
green-coated men of the Prince of Wales Loyal
American Volunteers. Northern loyalists, they had
been in the war since 1777. They had seen little
fighting until they sailed south in 1780. After the fall
of Charleston, Cornwallis had divided them into
detachments and used them to garrison small posts,
with disastrous results. In August 1780 at Hanging
Rock, Sumter had attacked one detachment, virtually
annihilating it. The colonel of the regiment was
cashiered for cowardice. Another detachment was
mauled by Francis Marion at Great Savannah around
the same time. It was hardly a brilliant record. But
this company of light infantry, supposedly the boldest
and best of the regiment, might be eager to seek
revenge for their lost comrades.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Tarleton&rsquo;s Legion</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Tarleton gave the Carolinas a
foretaste of modern war. His
Legion was a fast-moving,
hard-hitting combat team, accounted
the best in the British
army at that stage of the war.
Its specialty was relentless
pursuit followed by all-out
attack. In Tarleton&rsquo;s hands,
the Legion became a weapon
of terror directed at civilian
and soldier alike. As in modern
war, this tactic spawned as
much partisan resistance as
fear and was ultimately self-defeating.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Behind the light infantry marched the first battalion
of the Royal Fusiliers of the 7th Regiment. This
was one of the oldest regiments in the British army,
with a proud history that went back to 1685. Known
as the &ldquo;City of London&rdquo; regiment, it had been in
America since 1773. A detachment played a vital
part in repulsing the December 31, 1775, attack on
Quebec, which wrecked American plans to make
Canada the 14th State. Among the 426 Americans
captured was Daniel Morgan. Few if any of the men
in Tarleton&rsquo;s ranks had been in that fight. The
167-man battalion were all new recruits. When they
arrived in Charleston early in December, the British
commander there had described them to Cornwallis
as &ldquo;so bad, not above a third can possibly move with
a regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British government was having problems recruiting
men for America. It had never been easy to
persuade Englishmen to join the army and endure its
harsh discipline and low pay. Now, with the war in
America growing more and more unpopular, army
recruiters were scouring the jails and city slums.
Cornwallis had decided to use these new recruits as
garrison troops at Ninety Six. Tarleton, as we have
seen earlier, had borrowed them for his pursuit.
Although the 7th&rsquo;s motto was <i>Nec aspera terrent</i>
(&ldquo;hardships do not frighten us&rdquo;), it must have been an
unnerving experience for these men, little more than
a month after a long, debilitating sea voyage, to find
themselves deep in the backwoods of South Carolina,
marching through the cold, wet darkness to
their first battle.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly worsening the Fusiliers&rsquo; morale was
the low opinion their officers had of Banastre Tarleton.
The commander of the regiment, Maj. Timothy
Newmarsh, had stopped at a country house for the
night about a week ago, during the early stage of the
pursuit, and had not been discreet in voicing his
fears for the safety of the expedition. He said he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
certain they would be defeated, because almost
every officer in the army detested Tarleton, who had
been promoted over the heads of men who had been
in the service before he was born.</p>
<p>Behind the Royal Fusiliers trudged a 200-man
battalion of the 71st Scottish Highlanders (Fraser&rsquo;s),
who probably did not find the night march through
the woods as forbidding as the city men of the
Fusiliers. At least half were relatively new recruits
who had arrived in America little more than a year
ago. The rest were veterans who had been campaigning
in the rebellious colonies since 1776. They
had sailed south to help the British capture Georgia
in 1778 and had fought well in one of the most
devastating royal victories of the southern campaign,
the rout of the Americans at Briar Creek, Ga.,
in early 1779. They were commanded by Maj. Archibald
McArthur, a tough veteran who had served with
the Scottish Brigade in the Dutch army, considered
one of the finest groups of fighting men in Europe.</p>
<p>Between the 71st and the 7th Regiments plodded
some 18 blue-coated royal artillerymen, leading
horses carrying two brass cannon and 60 rounds of
round shot and case shot (also known as canister
because each &ldquo;case&rdquo; was full of smaller bullet-size
projectiles that scattered in flight). These light guns
were considered an important innovation when they
were introduced into the British army in 1775.
Because they could be dismantled and carried on
horses, they could be moved over rough terrain
impassable to ordinary artillery with its cumbersome
ammunition wagons. The two guns Tarleton had
with him could also be fitted with shafts that enabled
four men to carry them around a battlefield, if the
ground was too muddy or rough for their carriages.
With the shafts, they resembled grasshoppers, and
this was what artillerymen, fond of nicknames for
their guns, called them.</p>
<p>The cannon added to Tarleton&rsquo;s confidence. They
could hurl a 3-pound round shot almost 1,000 yards.
There was little likelihood that Morgan had any
artillery with him. All the southern army&rsquo;s artillery
had been captured at Camden. These guns with
Tarleton may have been two of the captured pieces,
which had originally been captured from the British
at Saratoga in 1777.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Few field officers served the
Continental Army with greater
skill or devotion to duty than
John Eager Howard. When
the revolution broke out, he
was 23, the son of a landed
Maryland family, brought up
in an atmosphere of ease and
comfort. He saw his first
hostile fire as a captain of
militia at White Plains (1776).
The next year, as a major in
the regulars, he helped lead
the 4th Maryland at Germantown.
In the Southern Campaign
of 1780-81, regiments
he led fought with great courage
at Camden, Cowpens,
Guilford Courthouse, Hobkirks
Hill, and Eutaw Springs.
Nathanael Greene considered
Howard &ldquo;as good an officer as
the world affords.&rdquo; After the
war, &lsquo;Light-Horse Harry&rsquo; Lee
described Howard as &ldquo;always
to be found where the battle
raged, pressing into close
action to wrestle with fixed
bayonet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behind the infantry and artillery rode the cavalry
of the British Legion and a 50-man troop of the 17th
Light Dragoons, giving Tarleton about 350 horsemen.
In scabbards dangling from straps over their
shoulders were the fearsome sabers that could lop
off a man&rsquo;s arm with a single stroke. The Legion
cavalry were, relatively speaking, amateurs, with
only their courage and belief in their cause to
animate them. The 17th Dragoons were regulars to
the core, intensely proud of their long tradition. On
their brass helmets they wore a death&rsquo;s head and
below it a scroll with the words &ldquo;or glory.&rdquo; They and
their officers were somewhat disdainful of the British
Legion.</p>

<p class="pcap">A helmet of the 17th Light Dragoons, c. 1780.</p>
</div>
<p>Although their reputation among the patriots was
good, the Legion had several times exhibited cowardice
unthinkable to a 17th dragoon. When the
British army advanced into Charlotte in the fall
of 1780, they had been opposed by 75 or 80 back-country
riflemen. Tarleton was ill with yellow fever
and his second in command, Maj. George Hanger,
had ordered them to charge the Americans. The
Legion refused to budge. Not even the exhortations
of Cornwallis himself stirred them until infantry had
dislodged the riflemen from cover. They apparently
remembered the punishment they had taken at
Blackstocks, when Tarleton&rsquo;s orders had exposed
them to sharpshooters.</p>
<p>As dawn began turning the black night sky to
charcoal gray, Tarleton ordered a select group of
cavalry to the front of his infantry. They soon
collided with American scouts on horseback and
captured two of them. These captives told them that
Morgan and his men were only a few miles away.
Tarleton immediately ordered two troops of the
Legion cavalry, under one of his best officers, Capt.
David Ogilvie, to reinforce his vanguard. Ogilvie
galloped into the murky dawn. Within a half hour,
one of his troopers came racing back with unexpected
news. The patriots were not retreating! They
were drawn up in an open wood in battle formation.</p>
<p>Tarleton halted his army and summoned his loyalist
guides. They instantly recognized the place where
Morgan had chosen to fight&mdash;the Cowpens. It was
familiar to everyone who had visited or lived in the
South Carolina back country. They gave Tarleton a
detailed description of the battleground. The woods
were open and free from swamps. The Broad River
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
was about six miles away.</p>
<p>The ground, Tarleton decided, was made to order
for the rebels&rsquo; destruction. In fact, America could
not produce a place more suitable to his style of war.
His bloodhound instinct dominant, Banastre Tarleton
assumed that Morgan, having run away from
him for two days, was still only trying to check his
advance and gain time to retreat over the Broad
River. Morgan failed to stop him at the Pacolet. He
would fail even more disastrously here. With six miles
of open country in the Americans&rsquo; rear, Tarleton
looked forward to smashing Morgan&rsquo;s ranks with
an infantry attack and then unleashing his Legion
horsemen to hunt down the fleeing survivors. Tarleton
never dreamt that Daniel Morgan was planning to
fight to the finish.</p>
<h3><b>7</b></h3>
<p>While Tarleton&rsquo;s troops spent most of the night
marching along the twisting, dipping Green River
Road, Daniel Morgan&rsquo;s men had been resting at Cowpens
and listening to their general&rsquo;s battle plan. First
Morgan outlined it for his officers, then he went from
campfire to campfire explaining it to his men.</p>
<p>The plan was based on the terrain at Cowpens and
on the knowledge of Tarleton&rsquo;s battle tactics that
Morgan had from such friends as Richard Winn.
Morgan probably told his men what he repeated in
later years&mdash;he expected nothing from Tarleton but
&ldquo;downright fighting.&rdquo; The young Englishman was
going to come straight at them in an all-out charge.</p>
<p>To repel that charge, Morgan adopted tactics he
had himself helped design at Saratoga. There was a
similarity between the little army he commanded at
Cowpens and the men he led in northern New York.
Like his old rifle corps, his militia were crack shots.
But they could not stand up against a British bayonet
charge. It took too long to load and fire a rifle, and it
was not equipped with a bayonet.</p>
<p>He had complete confidence in his Continentals.
No regiment in the British army had a prouder tradition
than these men from Maryland and Delaware.
They and their comrades in arms had demonstrated
their heroism on a dozen battlefields. Above all,
Morgan trusted their commander, Lt. Col. John
Eager Howard of Maryland. At the battle of Germantown
in 1777, he had led his 4th Maryland Regiment
in a headlong charge that drove the British
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
light infantry in panicky flight from their battle line
back to their tents. After the American defeat at
Camden, Howard had rounded up the survivors of
his own and other regiments and led them on a
three-day march to Charlotte through swamps and
forests to elude British pursuit. Someone asked what
they had to eat during that time. &ldquo;Some peaches,&rdquo;
Howard said.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/i22.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="463" />
<p class="pcap">An American canteen of the type used by militia at Cowpens.</p>
</div>
<p>Morgan was equally sure of the steadiness of the
ex-Continentals who made up the bulk of his two
companies of Virginia six-months militiamen. He
told them that he was going to station them on either
side of the Maryland and Delaware regulars, on the
first crest of the almost invisibly rising slope that
constituted Cowpens. A professional soldier would
consider this the &ldquo;military crest&rdquo; because it was the
high ground from which the best defense could be
made. Behind this crest, the land sloped off to a
slight hollow, and then rose to another slightly
higher hump of earth, which was the geographical
crest of the battleground. Here Morgan planned to
post William Washington and his 80 dragoons. To
make them more of a match for Tarleton&rsquo;s 300 horsemen,
he called for volunteers to serve with Washington.
About 40 men stepped forward, led by Andrew
Pickens&rsquo; friend, James McCall. Morgan gave them
sabers and told them to obey Washington&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>There was nothing unusual or brilliant about this
part of Morgan&rsquo;s battle plan. It was simply good
sense and good tactics to select the most advantageous
ground for his infantry and keep Washington&rsquo;s
cavalry out of the immediate reach of Tarleton&rsquo;s far
more numerous horsemen. It was in his plan for the
militia that Morgan demonstrated his genius. At
Camden, Horatio Gates had tried to use the militia
as if they were regulars, positioning them in his
battle line side by side with the Continentals. They
swiftly demonstrated that they could not withstand a
British bayonet charge.</p>
<p>Morgan decided that he would use his militia in a
different way. He put the backwoodsmen under the
command of Andrew Pickens and carefully explained
what he wanted them to do. They were
going to form a line about 150 yards ahead of
Howard and the Continentals. They were to hold
their fire until the British were within &ldquo;killing distance.&rdquo;
They were to get off two or three shots and
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
retreat behind the Continentals, who would carry on
the battle while the militiamen re-formed and came
back into the fight on the British flanks.</p>
<p>A select group of riflemen, considered the best
shots in the army, were to advance another hundred
yards on both sides of the Green River Road and
begin skirmishing with the British as soon as they
appeared. This was the tactic Sumter had used at
Blackstocks to tempt Tarleton into a reckless charge,
and it had cost the British heavy casualties.</p>
<p>His plan complete, Morgan did not retire to his
tent, in the style of more autocratic generals, and
await the moment of battle. He understood the
importance of personal leadership. Above all, he
knew how to talk to the militia. He was a man of the
frontier, like them. Although he was crippled from
his sciatica, he limped from group to group while
they cooked their suppers and smoked their pipes,
telling them how sure he was that they could whip
&ldquo;Benny.&rdquo; Sixteen-year-old Thomas Young was among
the cavalry volunteers. He remembered how Morgan
helped them to fix their sabers, joked with them
about their sweethearts, told them to keep up their
courage and victory was certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long after I laid down,&rdquo; Young recalled, &ldquo;he was
going among the soldiers encouraging them and
telling them that the &lsquo;Old Wagoner&rsquo; would crack his
whip over Ben in the morning, as sure as they lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hold up your heads, boys, give them three
fires, and you will be free,&rdquo; Morgan told them. &ldquo;Then
when you return to your homes, how the old folks will
bless you, and the girls will kiss you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
that he slept a wink that night,&rdquo; Young said later.</p>
<p>Many of these young militiamen had something
else to motivate them&mdash;a fierce resentment of the
way the British and loyalists had abused, and in some
cases killed, their friends and relatives. Thomas
Young&rsquo;s brother, John, had been shot down in the
spring of 1780 when loyalist militia attacked the
Youngs&rsquo; regiment. &ldquo;I do not believe I had ever used
an oath before that day,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;But then I
tore open my bosom and swore that I would never
rest until I had avenged his death.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">A powder horn and linstock

used such equipment.</p>
</div>
<p>Another South Carolinian, 17-year-old James
Collins, had fought with Sumter and other militia
leaders since the fall of Charleston. He remembered
with particular anger the swath of desolation left by
loyalists when they plundered rebel Americans on
the east side of the Broad. &ldquo;Women were insulted
and stripped of every article of decent clothing they
might have on and every article of bedding, clothing
or furniture was taken&mdash;knives, forks, dishes, spoons.
Not a piece of meat or a pint of salt was left. They
even entered houses where men lay sick of the
smallpox ... dragged them out of their sick beds into
the yard and put them to death in cold blood in the
presence of their wives and children. We were too
weak to repel them....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Morgan&rsquo;s Army</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>On paper Morgan&rsquo;s army was
inferior. The British numbered
some 1100, all regulars and
most of them tested in battle.
Morgan had at best a little
over 800 troops, and half of
them were militia. Numbers,
though, deceive, for Morgan&rsquo;s
army was in fact a first-rate
detachment of light infantry,
needing only leadership to
win victories.</p>
<p>The core of Morgan&rsquo;s army
was a mixed brigade of Maryland
and Delaware Continentals
under Col. John Eager
Howard, about 320 men. They
were supported by 80 or so
Continental dragoons under
Col. William Washington.</p>

<p>These Continentals were tough

than the green troops who

200 were ex-Continentals from
Virginia. Morgan thought
enough of them to employ
them in the main battle line.
The other militia were recruited
by that wily partisan leader,
Andrew Pickens, and William
Davidson, a superb militia
general. It&rsquo;s unlikely that such
able commanders would have
filled their ranks with the
wavering and shiftless.</p>

minimized their weakness.

centuries later.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Collins and his friends had joined Sumter, only to
encounter Tarleton at Fishing Creek. &ldquo;It was a
perfect rout and an indiscriminate slaughter,&rdquo; he
recalled. Retreating to the west, Collins described
how they lived before Morgan and his regulars
arrived to confront the British and loyalists. &ldquo;We
kept a flying camp, never staying long in one place,
never camping near a public road ... never stripping
off saddles.&rdquo; When they ate, &ldquo;each one sat down
with his sword by his side, his gun lying across his lap
or under the seat on which he sat.&rdquo; It soon became
necessary &ldquo;for their safety,&rdquo; Collins said, to join
Morgan. At Cowpens, men like James Collins were
fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>Equally desperate&mdash;and angry&mdash;were men like
Joseph Hughes, whose father had been killed by the
loyalists. Hughes had been living as an &ldquo;out-lier,&rdquo;
hiding in the woods near his home with a number of
other men who remained loyal to militia colonel
Thomas Brandon. One day he ventured out to visit
his family. As he approached the house, three loyalists
sprang out of the door with leveled guns, shouting:
&ldquo;You damned Rebel, you are our prisoner!&rdquo;
Hughes wheeled his horse and leaped the gate to
escape the hail of bullets.</p>
<p>At Cowpens, Hughes, though still in his teens, was
given command of a company of militia. Probably by
his side was his close friend, William Kennedy,
considered one of the best shots in South Carolina.
His prowess with the rifle had discouraged loyalists
from venturing into the rebel settlement at Fairforest
Shoals. His gun had a peculiar <i>crack</i> which his
friends recognized. When they heard it, they often
said: &ldquo;There is another Tory less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men who had turned out to fight for Andrew
Pickens had no illusions about what would happen
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
to them if they were captured. Like their leader, they
were violators of their paroles, liable to instant
execution if captured. On the night of the 16th,
Cornwallis, in his camp at Turkey Creek on the
other side of the Broad, demonstrated what else
would happen to their families. He wrote out an
order for Cruger at Ninety Six. &ldquo;If Colonel Pickens
has left any Negroes, cattle or other property that
may be useful ... I would have it seized accordingly
and I desire that his houses may be burned and his
plantations as far as lies in your power totally destroyed
and himself if ever taken instantly hanged.&rdquo;
The order was executed the moment it was received
at Ninety Six. Rebecca Pickens and her children were
hurried into the January cold to watch their house,
barns, and other outbuildings become bonfires.</p>
<p>The 200 Georgians and South Carolinians in
Morgan&rsquo;s army were all veterans of numerous battles,
most of them fought under Elijah Clarke&rsquo;s
command. With their leader wounded, they were
now commanded by James Jackson and John Cunningham.
Morgan had largely relied on Jackson to
rally them. Like most of Morgan&rsquo;s men, he was
young, only 23. He had fought Tarleton at Blackstocks,
where he had ducked bullets to seize the
guns of dead British to continue the fight after his
men ran out of ammunition. In one respect, Jackson
was unusual. He had been born in England. He
arrived in America in 1774 and seems to have
become an instant Georgian, right down to extreme
pugnacity and a prickly sense of honor. He had
recently quarreled with the rebel lieutenant governor
of Georgia, challenged him to a duel, and killed
him. Morgan appointed Jackson brigade major of the
militia, making him Pickens&rsquo; second in command.</p>
<p>At least as formidable as Jackson&rsquo;s veterans were
the 140 North Carolinians under Maj. Joseph
McDowell. They had fought at Musgrove&rsquo;s Mill and
in other battles in the summer of 1780 and had
scrambled up the slopes of Kings Mountain to help
destroy the loyalist army entrenched there.</p>
<p>Well before dawn, Morgan sent cavalry under a
Georgian, Joshua Inman, to reconnoiter the Green
River Road. They bumped into Tarleton&rsquo;s advance
guard and hastily retreated. Into the Cowpens they
pounded to shout the alarm.</p>
<p>Morgan seemed to be everywhere on his horse,
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
rousing the men. &ldquo;Boys, get up, Benny is coming,&rdquo; he
shouted. Quickly militia and Continentals got on
their feet and bolted down cold hominy they had
cooked the night before. Morgan ordered the baggage
wagons to depart immediately to a safe place,
about a mile in the rear. The militiamen&rsquo;s horses
were tied to trees, under a guard, closer to the rear
of the battle line.</p>
<p>Morgan rode down to the picked riflemen who
were going to open the fight and told them he had
heard a lot of tall tales about who were the better
shots, the men of Georgia or Carolina. Here was the
chance to settle the matter and save their country in
the bargain. &ldquo;Let me see which are most entitled to
the credit of brave men, the boys of Carolina or those
of Georgia,&rdquo; he roared. By positioning Georgians on
the left of the road and Carolinians on the right,
Morgan shrewdly arranged to make his competition
highly visible.</p>
<p>To Pickens&rsquo; men Morgan made a full-fledged
speech, reminding them of what the British had
already done to their friends and many of their
families. He pounded his fist in his hand and told
them that this was their moment of revenge. He also
praised the courage with which they had fought the
British in earlier skirmishes, without the help of
regulars or cavalry. Here they had the support of
veterans in both departments. He had not the slightest
doubt of victory if they obeyed their orders and
fought like men. He told them his experiences with
his rifle regiment at Saratoga and other battles,
where they had beaten the flower of the British
army, generals far more distinguished than Benny
Tarleton and regiments far more famous than the
units Tarleton was leading.</p>
<p>To his Continentals, Morgan made an even more
emotional speech. He called them &ldquo;my friends in
arms, my dear boys,&rdquo; and asked them to remember
Saratoga, Monmouth, Paoli, Brandywine. &ldquo;This day,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you must play your parts for honor and
liberty&rsquo;s cause.&rdquo; He restated his battle plan, reminding
them that after two or three rounds the militia
would retreat under orders. They would not be
running away. They would be falling back to regroup
and harry the enemy&rsquo;s flanks.</p>
<p>A Delaware soldier watching Morgan&rsquo;s performance
said that by the time he was through, there was
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
not a man in the army who was not &ldquo;in good spirits
and very willing to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood-red rising sun crept above the hills
along the slopes of Thicketty Mountain to the east.
The men stamped their feet and blew on their hands
to keep warm. It was cold, but the air was crisp and
clear. The mighty ramparts of the Blue Ridge were
visible, 30 miles away. Much too distant for a refuge
now, even if the swollen Broad River did not lie
between them and Morgan&rsquo;s men.</p>
<p>Suddenly the British army was emerging from the
woods along the Green River Road. The green-coated
dragoons at their head slowed and then
stopped. So did the red-coated light infantry behind
them. An officer in a green coat rode to the head of
the column and studied the American position.
Everyone in the rebel army recognized him. It was
Banastre Tarleton.</p>
<h3><b>8</b></h3>
<p>Tarleton soon found his position at the head of
the column was hazardous. The Georgia and Carolina
riflemen drifted toward him through the trees on
either side of the road. <i>Pop pop</i> went their rifles.
Bullets whistled close to Tarleton&rsquo;s head. He turned
to the 50 British Legion dragoons commanded by
Captain Ogilvie and ordered them to &ldquo;drive in&rdquo; the
skirmishers. With a shout the dragoons charged. The
riflemen rested their weapons against convenient
trees and took steady aim. Again the long barrels
blazed. Dragoons cried out and pitched from their
saddles, horses screamed in pain. The riflemen
flitted back through the open woods, reloading as
they ran, a trick that continually amazed the British.
Some whirled and fired again, and more dragoons
crashed to earth. In a minute or two the riflemen
were safely within the ranks of Pickens&rsquo; militia. The
dragoons recoiled from this array of fire power and
cantered back toward the British commander. They
had lost 15 out of their 50 men.</p>
<p>Tarleton meanwhile continued studying the rebel
army. At a distance of about 400 yards he was able to
identify Pickens&rsquo; line of militia, whose numbers he
guessed to be about a thousand. He estimated the
Continentals and Virginia six-month militia in the
second line at about 800. Washington&rsquo;s cavalry on
the crest behind the Continentals he put at 120, his
only accurate figure.</p>

</div>
<p>Tarleton was not in the least intimidated by these
odds, even though his estimates doubled Morgan&rsquo;s
actual strength. He was supremely confident that his
regular infantry could sweep the riflemen and militia
off the field, leaving only the outnumbered Continentals
and cavalry. The ground looked level enough
to repeat the Waxhaws rout. In his self-confidence
and growing battle fever, he did not even bother to
confer on a tactical plan with Newmarsh of the
Fusiliers or McArthur of the Highlanders. He simply
issued them orders to form a line of battle. The
infantry was told to drop their heavy packs and
blanket rolls. The light infantry companies were
ordered to file to the right, until they extended as far
as the flank of the militia facing them. The Legion
infantry was ordered into line beside them. Next
came a squad of blue-coated artillerymen with their
brass grasshopper. They unpacked their gun and
ammunition boxes and mounted them on the wheeled
carriage with professional speed. In the Royal Artillery
school at Woolrich the men who designed the
gun estimated this task should take no more than
two minutes.</p>
<p>The light infantry and Legion infantry were now
told to advance a hundred yards, while the Fusiliers
moved into line on their left. The other grasshopper
was placed on the right of this regiment, no doubt to
bolster the courage of the raw recruits. The two guns
began hurling shot into the woods, firing at the
riflemen who were filtering back to potshot the
tempting red and green targets.</p>
<p>On each flank, Tarleton posted a captain and 50
dragoons, more than enough, he thought, to protect
his infantry from a cavalry charge.</p>
<p>Tarleton ordered the Highlanders to form a line
about 150 yards in the rear of the Fusiliers, slightly to
their left. These veteran Scots and 200 Legion
cavalry were his reserve, to be committed to the
fight when they were most needed.</p>
<p>Everywhere Tarleton looked, he later recalled, he
saw &ldquo;the most promising assurance of success.&rdquo; The
officers and men were full of fire and vigor. Every
order had been obeyed with alacrity. There was not
a sign of weariness, though his men had marched
half the night. They had been chasing these Americans
for two weary weeks. They knew that if they
beat them here, the war in South Carolina would be
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
over. To make this a certainty, Banastre Tarleton
issued a cruel order. They were to give no quarter,
take no prisoners.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/i25c.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="570" />
<p class="pcap">The only reasonably sure
patriot flag on the field was a
damask color, cut from the
back of a chair, that Washington&rsquo;s
dragoons carried. The original, which
measures only 18 inches by
18, is in the collection of the
Washington Light Infantry
Corps of Charleston.</p>
</div>
<p>The order might have made some gruesome sense
as far as the militia was concerned. Almost every
one of them was considered a criminal, fighting in
direct violation of the law as laid down by His
Majesty&rsquo;s officers in numerous proclamations. Killing
them would save the trouble of hanging them.
But to order his men to give no quarter to Morgan&rsquo;s
Continentals was a blatant violation of the rules of
war under which both sides had fought for the past
five years. It was graphic glimpse of the rage which
continued American resistance was igniting in Englishmen
like Banastre Tarleton.</p>
<p>One British officer in the battle later said that
Major Newmarsh was still posting the officers of the
Fusiliers, the last regiment into line, when Tarleton
ordered the advance to begin. With a tremendous
shout, the green- and red-coated line surged forward.</p>
<p>From the top of the slope, Morgan called on his
men to reply. &ldquo;They give us the British haloo, boys,&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Give them the Indian haloo.&rdquo; A howl of
defiance leaped from 800 American throats. Simultaneously,
the Georgians and North Carolinians
opened fire behind the big trees. Some of the new
recruits of the Fusiliers regiment revealed their
nervousness by firing back. Their officers quickly
halted this tactical violation. British infantry fired by
the volley, and the riflemen were out of musket
range anyway. Rifles outshot muskets by 150 yards.</p>
<p>Morgan watched the riflemen give the British
infantry &ldquo;a heavy and galling fire&rdquo; as they advanced.
But the sharpshooters made no pretense of holding
their ground. Morgan had ordered them to fall back
to Pickens&rsquo; militia and join them for serious fighting.
On the British came, their battle drums booming,
their fifes shrilling, the two brass cannon barking.
The artillerymen apparently did not consider the
militiamen an important target. They blasted at the
Continentals on the crest. Most of their rounds
whizzed over the heads of the infantry and came
dangerously close to Colonel Washington and his
horsemen. He led his men to a safer position on the
slope of the geographical crest, behind the left wing
of the main American line.</p>
<p>Andrew Pickens and his fellow colonels, all on
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
horseback, urged the militia to hold their fire, to
aim low and pick out &ldquo;the epaulette men&rdquo;&mdash;the
British officers with gold braid on their shoulders.</p>
<div class="box">

<p><i>This is the order in which

on the battlefield.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It was no easy task to persuade these men not to
fire while those 16-inch British bayonets bore down
on them, glistening wickedly in the rising sun. The
closer they got, the more difficult it would be to
reload their clumsy muskets and get off another shot
before the British were on top of them. But the
musket was a grossly inaccurate weapon at anything
more than 50 yards. This was the &ldquo;killing distance&rdquo;
for which Pickens and Morgan wanted the men to
wait. The steady fire of the grasshoppers, expertly
served by the British artillerymen, made the wait
even more harrowing.</p>
<p>Then came the moment of death. &ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; snarled
Andrew Pickens. &ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; echoed his colonels up and
down the line. The militia muskets and rifles belched
flame and smoke. The British line recoiled as bullets
from over 300 guns hurtled among them. Everywhere
officers, easily visible at the heads of their
companies, went down. It was probably here that
Newmarsh of the Fusiliers, who had been so pessimistic
about fighting under Tarleton, fell with a
painful wound. But confidence in their favorite
weapon, the bayonet, and the knowledge that they
were confronting militia quickly overcame the shock
of this first blow. The red and green line surged
forward again.</p>
<p>Thomas Young, sitting on his horse among Washington&rsquo;s
cavalry, later recalled the noise of the
battle. &ldquo;At first it was <i>pop pop pop</i> (the sound of the
rifles) and then a whole volley,&rdquo; he said. Then the
regulars fired a volley. &ldquo;It seemed like one sheet of
flame from right to left,&rdquo; Young said.</p>
<p>The British were not trained to aim and fire. Their
volley firing was designed to intimidate more than to
kill. It made a tremendous noise and threw a cloud
of white smoke over the battlefield. Most of the
musket balls flew high over the heads of the Americans.
Decades later, visitors to Cowpens found bullets
embedded in tree trunks as high as 30 feet from
the ground.</p>
<p>Out of the smoke the regulars came, bayonets
leveled. James Collins was among the militiamen
who decided that the two shots requested by Morgan
was more than they could manage. &ldquo;We gave the
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
enemy one fire,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;When they charged us
with their bayonets we gave way and retreated for
our horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the militia hurried around Morgan&rsquo;s left
flank, following Pickens and his men. A lesser
number may have found the right flank more convenient.
The important thing, as far as they were
concerned, was to escape those bayonets and reach
the position where Morgan promised them they
would be protected by Howard&rsquo;s Continentals and
Washington&rsquo;s cavalry. Watching from the military
crest, Sgt. William Seymour of the Delaware Continentals
thought the militia retreated &ldquo;in very good
order, not seeming to be in the least confused.&rdquo; Thus
far, Morgan&rsquo;s plan was working smoothly.</p>
<p>Tarleton ordered the 50 dragoons on his right
flank to pursue Pickens and the bulk of the militia.
If, as he later claimed, the British commander had
seen William Washington and his 120 cavalry at the
beginning of the battle, this order was a blunder.
With 200 cavalrymen in reserve, waiting a summons
to attack, Tarleton sent 50 horsemen to face twice
their number of mounted Americans. He may have
assumed that Morgan was using standard battle
tactics and regarded Washington&rsquo;s cavalry as his
reserve, which he would not commit until necessity
required it. The British commander never dreamt
that the Old Wagoner had made a solemn promise to
the militiamen that he would protect them from the
fearsome green dragoons at all costs.</p>
<p>As the militia retreated. Tarleton&rsquo;s cavalry thundered
down on them. their deadly sabers raised.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought James Collins, &ldquo;my hide is in the
loft.&rdquo; A wild melee ensued, with the militiamen
dodging behind trees, parrying the slashing sabers
with their gun barrels. &ldquo;They began to make a few
hacks at some,&rdquo; Collins said, &ldquo;thinking they would
have another Fishing Creek frolic.&rdquo; As the militiamen
dodged the swinging sabers, the British dragoons
lost all semblance of a military formation and
became &ldquo;pretty much scattered,&rdquo; Collins said.</p>
<p>At that moment, &ldquo;Col. Washington&rsquo;s cavalry was
among them like a whirlwind,&rdquo; Collins exultantly
recalled. American sabers sent dragoons keeling
from their horses. &ldquo;The shock was so sudden and
violent, they could not stand it, and immediately
betook themselves to flight.&rdquo; Collins said. &ldquo;They
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
appeared to be as hard to stop as a drove of wild
Choctaw steers, going to Pennsylvania market.&rdquo;
Washington&rsquo;s cavalry hotly pursued them and &ldquo;in a
few minutes the clashing of swords was out of
hearing and quickly out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Young was one of the South Carolina
volunteers in this ferocious charge. He was riding a
&ldquo;little tackey&rdquo;&mdash;a very inferior horse&mdash;which put
him at a disadvantage. When he saw one of the
British dragoons topple from his saddle, he executed
&ldquo;the quickest swap I ever made in my life&rdquo; and
leaped onto &ldquo;the finest horse I ever rode.&rdquo; Young
said the American charge carried them through the
50 dragoons, whereupon they wheeled and attacked
them in the rear. On his new steed he joined
Washington&rsquo;s pursuit of the fleeing British.</p>
<p>In spite of William Washington&rsquo;s victorious strike,
many militiamen decided that Cowpens was unsafe
and leaped on their horses and departed. Among the
officers who took prompt action to prevent further
panic was young Joseph Hughes. Although blood
streamed from a saber cut on his right hand, he drew
his sword and raced after his fleeing company.
Outrunning them, he whirled and flailed at them
with the flat of his blade, roaring. &ldquo;You damned
cowards, halt and fight&mdash;there is more danger in
running than in fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Pickens rode among other sprinters, shouting.
&ldquo;Are you going to leave your mothers, sisters,
sweethearts and wives to such unmerciful scoundrels,
such a horde of thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the battlefield, volley after volley of musketry
thundered, cannon boomed. The Continentals and
the British regulars were slugging it out. Daniel
Morgan rode up to the milling militiamen, waving
his sword and roaring in a voice that outdid the
musketry: &ldquo;Form, form, my brave fellows. Give
them one more fire and the day is ours. Old Morgan
was never beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would they fight or run? For a few agonizing
moments, the outcome of the battle teetered on the
response of these young backwoodsmen.</p>
<h3><b>9</b></h3>
<p>On the other side of the crest behind which
Morgan and Pickens struggled to rally the militia,
Banastre Tarleton was absorbed in pressing home
the attack with his infantry. He seems to have paid
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
no attention to the rout of his cavalry on the right.
Nor did any of his junior officers in the Legion
attempt to support the fleeing dragoons with reinforcements
from the 200-man cavalry reserve. At
this point in the battle, Tarleton badly needed a
second in command who had the confidence to
make on-the-spot decisions. One man cannot be
everywhere on a battlefield. Unfortunately for Tarleton,
Maj. George Hanger, his second in command,
was in a hospital in Camden, slowly recovering from
yellow fever.</p>
<p>With the militia out of the way, the British infantry
had advanced on the Continentals and begun blasting
volleys of musketry at them. The Continentals
volleyed back. Smoke enveloped the battlefield.
Tarleton later claimed the fire produced &ldquo;much
slaughter,&rdquo; but it is doubtful that either side could
see what they were shooting at after the first few
rounds. The British continued to fire high, hitting
few Continentals.</p>
<p>To Tarleton, the contest seemed &ldquo;equally balanced,&rdquo;
and he judged it the moment to throw in his
reserve. He ordered Major McArthur and his 71st
Highlanders into the battle line to the left of the
Fusiliers. This gave Tarleton over 700 infantrymen in
action to the rebels&rsquo; 420. Simultaneously, Tarleton
ordered the cavalry troop on the left to form a line
and swing around the American right flank.</p>
<p>These orders, shouted above the thunder of
musketry and the boom of the cannon, were
promptly obeyed. On the crest of the hill, Howard
saw the British threat developing. Once men are
outflanked and begin to be hit with bullets from two
sides, they are in danger of being routed. Howard
ordered the Virginia militia on his right to &ldquo;change
their front&rdquo; to meet this challenge. This standard
battlefield tactic requires a company to wheel and
face a flanking enemy.</p>

<p class="pcap">An officer of the Maryland
Regiment. He carries a spontoon,
which is both a badge
of office and in close combat
a useful weapon.</p>
</div>
<p>A battlefield is a confusing place, and the Virginians,
though mostly trained soldiers, were not
regulars who had lived and drilled together over the
previous months. Their captain shouted the order
given him by Howard, and the men wheeled and
began marching toward the rear. The Maryland and
Delaware Continentals, seeing this strange departure,
noting that it was done in perfect order and
with deliberation, assumed that they had missed an
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
order to fall back. They wheeled and followed the
Virginians. On the opposite flank, the other company
of Virginians repeated this performance. In 60
seconds the whole patriot line was retreating.</p>
<p>Behind the geographical crest of the hill, Morgan
and Pickens had managed to steady and reorganize
the militia. Morgan galloped back toward the military
crest on which he assumed the Continentals
were still fighting. He was thunderstruck to find
them retreating. In a fury, he rode up to Howard and
cried: &ldquo;Are you beaten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard pointed to his unbroken ranks and told
Morgan that soldiers who retreated in that kind of
order were not beaten. Morgan agreed and told him
to stay with the men and he would ride back and
choose the place where the Continentals should turn
and rally. The Old Wagoner spurred his horse ahead
toward the geographical crest of the hill, about 50
paces behind their first line.</p>
<p>On the British side of the battlefield, the sight of
the retreating Continentals revived hopes of an easy
victory. Major McArthur of the 71st sought out
Tarleton and urged him to order the cavalry reserve
to charge and turn the retreat into a rout. Tarleton
claimed that he sent this order to the cavalry, who
were now at least 400 yards away from the vortex of
the battle. Perhaps he did. It would very probably
have been obeyed if it had arrived in time. The
dragoons of the British Legion liked nothing so
much as chopping up a retreating enemy.</p>
<p>But events now occurred with a rapidity that made
it impossible for the cavalry to respond. The center
of Tarleton&rsquo;s line of infantry surged up the slope
after the Continentals, bayonets lowered, howling
for American blood. With almost half their officers
dead or wounded by now, they lost all semblance of
military formation.</p>
<p>Far down the battlefield, where he had halted his
pursuit of the British cavalry, William Washington
saw what was happening. He sent a horseman racing
to Morgan with a terse message. &ldquo;They are coming
on like a mob. Give them another fire and I will
charge them.&rdquo; Thomas Young, riding with Washington,
never forgot the moment. &ldquo;The bugle sounded,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We made a half circuit at full speed and
came upon the rear of the British line shouting and
charging like madmen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Simultaneously, Morgan reached the geographical
crest of the slope, with the Continentals only a few
steps behind him. He roared out an order to turn and
fire. The Continentals wheeled and threw a blast of
concentrated musketry into the faces of the charging
British. Officers and men toppled. The line recoiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them the bayonet,&rdquo; bellowed John Eager
Howard.</p>
<p>With a wild yell, the Continentals charged. The
astonished British panicked. Some of them, probably
the Fusiliers, flung themselves faced down on the
ground begging for mercy. Others, Thomas Young
recalled, &ldquo;took to the wagon road and did the
prettiest sort of running away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At almost the same moment, the Highlanders,
whose weight, if they had joined the charge, would
probably have been decisive, received an unexpected
blast of musketry from their flank. Andrew
Pickens and the militia had returned to the battle.
The backwoodsmen blazed at the Scotsmen, the
riflemen among them concentrating on the screen of
the cavalrymen. The cavalry fled and McArthur&rsquo;s
men found themselves fighting a private war with the
militia.</p>
<p>Astonished and appalled, Tarleton sent an officer
racing to the British Legion cavalry with orders for
them to form a line of battle about 400 yards away,
on the left of the road. He rode frantically among
his fleeing infantry, trying to rally them. His first
purpose was &ldquo;to protect the guns.&rdquo; To lose a cannon
was a major disgrace in 18th-century warfare. The
artillerymen were the only part of the British center
that had not succumbed to the general panic. They
continued to fire their grasshoppers, while the infantry
threw down their muskets or ran past them helter
skelter. Part of the artillery&rsquo;s tradition was an absolute
refusal to surrender. They lived by the code of
victory or death.</p>
<p>Once past the surrendering infantry, the Continentals
headed for the cannon. Like robots&mdash;or very
brave men&mdash;the artillerymen continued to fire until
every man except one was shot down or bayonetted.</p>
<p>The last survivor of the other gun crew was the
man who touched the match to the powder vent. A
Continental called on him to surrender this tool. The
artilleryman refused. As the Continental raised his
bayonet to kill him, Howard came up and blocked
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
the blow with his sword. A man that brave, the
colonel said, deserved to live. The artilleryman
surrendered the match to Howard.</p>
<p>Up and down the American line on the crest rang
an ominous cry. &ldquo;Give them Tarleton&rsquo;s quarter.&rdquo;
Remembering Waxhaws, the regulars and their Virginia
militia cousins were ready to massacre the
surrendered British. But Daniel Morgan, the epitome
of battle fury while the guns were firing, was a
humane and generous man. He rode into the shouting
infantrymen, ordering them to let the enemy live.
Junior officers joined him in enforcing the order.</p>
<p>Discipline as well as mercy made the order advisable.
The battle was not over. The Highlanders were
still fighting fiercely against Pickens&rsquo; men. Tarleton
was riding frantically toward his Legion cavalry to
bring them back into the battle. But the militia
riflemen were back on the field and Tarleton was
their prime target. Bullets whistled around him as he
rode. Several hit his horse. The animal crashed to
the ground. Tarleton sprang up, his saber ready. Dr.
Robert Jackson, assistant surgeon of the 71st, galloped
to the distraught lieutenant colonel and offered
him his horse. Tarleton refused. For a moment
he seemed ready to die on the chaotic battlefield
with his men. Dr. Jackson urged him again. Springing
off his horse, he told Tarleton, &ldquo;Your safety is of
the highest importance to the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarleton mounted Jackson&rsquo;s horse and rode to
rally his troops. Fastening a white handkerchief to
his cane, Jackson strolled toward the all-but-victorious
Americans. No matter how the battle ended, he
wanted to stay alive to tend the wounded.</p>
<p>Looking over his shoulder at the battlefield, Tarleton
clung to a shred of hope. An all-out charge by
the cavalry could still &ldquo;retrieve the day,&rdquo; he said
later. The Americans were &ldquo;much broken by their
rapid advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the British Legion had no appetite for another
encounter with the muskets of Andrew Pickens&rsquo;
militia. &ldquo;All attempts to restore order, recollection
[of past glory] or courage, proved fruitless,&rdquo; Tarleton
said. No less than 200 Legion dragoons wheeled their
horses and galloped for safety in the very teeth of
Tarleton&rsquo;s harangue. Fourteen officers and 40 dragoons
of the 17th Regiment obeyed his summons and
charged with him toward the all-but-disintegrated
British battle line. Their chief hope was to save the
cannon and rescue some small consolation from the
defeat.</p>

of whom had returned to the
battle after firing their two
shots and withdrawing. They
hit Tarleton&rsquo;s left flank hard
while Howard&rsquo;s troops rout
the British in the center,
giving Morgan the victory. A
gem of tactical planning and
maneuver, it was by far the
patriot&rsquo;s best fought battle of
the war.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The painting conveys a
close sense of the original
terrain with its scattered
hardwoods and undulating
ground that Morgan turned
to good use. The axis of the
battlefield, then as now, is
the old Green River Road,
which runs diagonally across
the scene. The diverging road
at left was not there at the
time of the battle.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>They never got there. Instead, they collided with
William Washington&rsquo;s cavalry that had wheeled after
their assault on the rear of the infantry and begun a
pursuit of the scampering redcoats, calling on them
to surrender, sabering those who refused. Washington
shouted an order to meet the British charge.
Most of his horsemen, absorbed in their pursuit of
the infantry, did not hear him. Washington, leading
the charge, did not realize he was almost unsupported.
The burly Virginian, remembering his humiliating
defeat at Lenuds Ferry in May 1780, had a
personal score to settle with Banastre Tarleton. He
headed straight for him.</p>
<p>Tarleton and two officers accepted Washington&rsquo;s
challenge. The Virginian slashed at the first man,
but his saber snapped at the hilt. As the officer stood
up in his stirrups, his saber raised for a fatal stroke,
Washington&rsquo;s bugler boy rode up and fired at the
Englishman. The second officer was about to make a
similar stroke when the sergeant-major of the 3d
Continental Dragoons arrived to parry the blow and
slash this assailant&rsquo;s sword arm. Tarleton made a
final assault. Washington parried his blow with his
broken sword. From his saddle holsters, Tarleton
drew two pistols in swift succession and fired at
Washington. One bullet wounded Washington&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>By this time Tarleton saw that the battle was totally
lost. The riflemen were running toward his horsemen,
and their bullets were again whistling close.
The Highlanders were being methodically surrounded
by Pickens&rsquo; militia and Morgan&rsquo;s Continentals. Summoning
his gallant 54 supporters, Tarleton galloped
down the Green River Road, a defeated man.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, the Highlanders were trying to
retreat. But Howard&rsquo;s Continentals and Washington&rsquo;s
cavalry were now between them and safety.
Through the center of their line charged Lt. Col.
James Jackson and some of his Georgians to try to
seize their standard. Bayonet-wielding Scotsmen were
about to kill Jackson when Howard and his Continentals
broke through the 71st&rsquo;s flank and saved
him. Howard called on the Highlanders to surrender.
Major McArthur handed his sword to Pickens and so
did most of the other officers. Pickens passed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
major&rsquo;s sword to Jackson and ordered him to escort
McArthur to the rear.</p>
<p>Captain Duncasson of the 71st surrendered his
sword to Howard. When Howard remounted, the
captain clung to his saddle and almost unhorsed him.
&ldquo;I expressed my displeasure,&rdquo; Howard recalled, &ldquo;and
asked him what he was about.&rdquo; Duncasson told
Howard that Tarleton had issued orders to give no
quarter and they did not expect any. The Continentals
were approaching with their bayonets still fixed.
He was afraid of what they might do to him. Howard
ordered a sergeant to protect the captain.</p>
<p>Around the patriots main position, a happy chaos
raged. In his exultation, Morgan picked up his
9-year-old drummer boy and kissed him on both
cheeks.</p>
<p>Others were off on new adventures. Cavalryman
Thomas Young joined half a dozen riders in pursuit
of prisoners and loot down the Green River Road.
They must have embarked on this foray shortly after
most of Tarleton&rsquo;s cavalry had deserted him and
before Tarleton himself quit the battlefield after the
encounter with Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went about twelve miles,&rdquo; Young said in his
recollections of the battle, &ldquo;and captured two British
soldiers, two negroes and two horses laden with
portmanteaus. One of the portmanteaus belonged to
a paymaster ... and contained gold.&rdquo; The other
riders decided this haul was too good to risk on the
road and told Young to escort the prisoners and the
money back to Cowpens. Young had ridden several
miles when he collided with Tarleton and his 54
troopers. Abandoning his captures, Young tried to
escape. He darted down a side road, but his horse
was so stiff from the hard exercise on the battlefield,
the British overtook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pistol was empty so I drew my sword and
made battle,&rdquo; the young militiaman said. &ldquo;I never
fought so hard in my life.&rdquo; He was hopelessly outnumbered.
In a few clanging seconds, a saber split a
finger on his left hand, another slashed his sword
arm, a third blade raked his forehead and the skin
fell over his eyes, blinding him. A saber tip speared
his left shoulder, a blade sank deep into his right
shoulder, and a final blow caught him on the back of
the head. Young clung to his horse&rsquo;s neck, half
conscious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Washington and Tarleton Duel</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the battle&rsquo;s most colorful
incidents occurred at the very
end. As defeat enveloped his
army, Tarleton tried to rally his
cavalry to the support of the
infantry. His Legion dragoons,
ignoring his orders and threats,
stampeded off the field. Only
the disciplined veterans of the
17th Dragoons followed him
into battle. They ran head-on
into the Continental dragoons
of Lt. Col. William Washington.
As sabers flashed, Washington
found himself far in advance
of his unit. What happened
next is described in a passage
from John Marshall&rsquo;s famous
<i>Life of George Washington</i>,
written when the event still
lingered in the memory of
contemporaries: &ldquo;Observing
[Washington about 30 yards in
front of his regiment], three
British officers wheeled about
and attacked him; the officer
on his left was aiming to cut
him down, when a sergeant
came up and intercepted the
blow by disabling the sword-arm,
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
at the same instant the
officer on his right was about
to make a stroke at him, when
a waiter, too small to wield a
sword, saved him by wounding
the officer with a pistol. At this
moment, Tarleton made a
thrust at him, which he parried,
upon which the officer
[Tarleton] retreated a few
paces and discharged his pistol
at him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is this account that probably
inspired the artist William
Ranney in 1845 to paint the
vigorous battle scene spread
across these pages. Washington
and Tarleton (on the black
horse) raise their swords in
the center while Washington&rsquo;s
servant boy levels his pistol at
the far dragoon. While the
painting errs in details of
costume&mdash;Washington and his
sergeant should be dressed in
white coats, not green, and
the British should be in green,
not red&mdash;it catches the spirit
of the duel.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i29.jpg" alt="Washington-Tarleton duel" width="1000" height="574" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>He was battered and bleeding, but his courage
saved his life. With the peculiar sportsmanship that
the British bring to war, they took him off his horse,
bandaged his wounds, and led him back to the main
road, where they rejoined Tarleton and the rest of
his party. One of the Tory guides that had led the
British through the back country to Cowpens recognized
Young and announced he was going to kill
him. He cocked his weapon. &ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; Young
said, &ldquo;about twenty British soldiers drew their swords,
cursed him for a coward wishing to kill a boy without
arms and a prisoner, and ran him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarleton ordered Young to ride beside him. He
asked him many questions about Morgan&rsquo;s army. He
was particularly interested in how many dragoons
Washington had. &ldquo;He had seventy,&rdquo; Young said,
&ldquo;and two volunteer companies of mounted militia.
But you know, they [the militia] won&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did today,&rdquo; Tarleton replied.</p>
<h3><b>10</b></h3>
<p>On the battlefield at Cowpens, Surgeons Robert
Jackson of the 71st Highlanders and Richard Pindell
of the 1st Maryland were doing their limited best to
help the wounded of both sides. There were 62
patriots and 200 British in need of medical attention,
which consisted largely of extracting musket balls, if
possible, bandaging wounds, and giving sufferers
some opium or whiskey, if any was available. The
battle had also cost the British 110 dead, including
10 officers. Only 12 patriots were killed in the battle,
though many more died later of wounds. But it was
the number of prisoners&mdash;some 530&mdash;that underscored
the totality of the American victory.</p>
<p>Even as prisoners, the British, particularly the
Scots, somewhat awed the Americans. Joseph
McJunkin said they &ldquo;looked like nabobs in their
flaming regimentals as they sat down with us, the
militia, in our tattered hunting shirts, black-smoked
and greasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other patriots were not content to inspect their
exotic captives. William Washington was having a
terse conference with Andrew Pickens. They agreed
that there was still a good chance to catch Tarleton.
But they needed enough men to overwhelm his 54-man
squadron. Washington changed his wounded
horse for a healthy mount and rounded up his scattered
dragoons. Pickens summoned some of his own
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
men and ordered James Jackson to follow him &ldquo;with
as many of the mounted militia as he could get.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/i30.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="248" />
<p class="pcap">Among the equipment captured
from the British was a
&ldquo;Travelling Forge,&rdquo; used by
artificers to keep horses shod
and wagons in repair.</p>
</div>
<p>Down the Green River Road they galloped, sabers
in hand. But Tarleton the cavalryman was not an
easy man to catch. He rode at his usual horse-killing
pace. A few miles above William Thompson&rsquo;s plantation
on Thicketty Creek, they found the expedition&rsquo;s
baggage wagons abandoned, 35 in all, most of
them belonging to the 7th Regiment. The fleeing
cavalry of the Legion had told the 100-man guard of
the defeat. The officer in command had set fire to all
the baggage that would burn, cut loose the wagon
horses, mounted his infantry two to a horse, and
ridden for the safety of Cornwallis&rsquo;s army. Abandoned
with the baggage were some 70 black slaves.
A short time later, a party of loyalists, fugitives from
the battlefield, reached the baggage train and began
to loot it. They were not long at this work before
Tarleton and his heartsick officers and troopers
came pounding down the road. They did not ask
questions about loyalty. They cut down the looters
without mercy.</p>
<p>Tarleton too was riding for Cornwallis&rsquo;s camp, but
he had more than safety on his mind. He assumed
the British commander was just across the Broad
River at Kings Mountain in a position to rescue the
500 or so men Morgan had taken prisoner. Perhaps
Tarleton met a loyalist scout or messenger somewhere
along the road. At any rate, he heard &ldquo;with
infinite grief and astonishment&rdquo; that the main army
was at least 35 miles away, at Turkey Creek.</p>
<p>This news meant a change of route. The British
decided they needed a guide. Near Thicketty
Creek they stopped at the house of a man named
Goudelock. He was known as a rebel. But Tarleton
probably put a saber to his throat and told him he
would be a dead man if he did not lead them to
Hamiltons Ford across the Broad River, near the
mouth of Bullocks Creek. Goudelock&rsquo;s terrified wife
watched this virtual kidnapping of her husband.</p>
<p>About half an hour after Tarleton and his troopers
departed to the southeast, Washington, Pickens,
and their dragoons and militia troopers rode into
Goudelock&rsquo;s yard. They had stopped to extinguish
the fires the British started in the baggage wagons
and collect some of the slaves the enemy had
abandoned. The Americans asked Mrs. Goudelock
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
if she had seen the British fugitives. Yes, she said.
What road did they take? She pointed down the
Green River Road, which led to Grindal Shoals on
the Pacolet. Like a great many people in every war,
she was more interested in personal survival than
national victory. If the Americans caught up to Tarleton,
there was certain to be a bloody struggle, in
which her husband might be killed. Mrs. Goudelock
preferred a live husband to a dead or captured
British commander.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig52">
<img src="images/i31.jpg" alt="" width="393" height="599" />
<p class="pcap">Congress awarded this silver
sword to Colonel Pickens for
his part in the battle.</p>
</div>
<p>The Americans galloped for the Pacolet. Not until
they had traveled 24 miles on this cold trail did they
turn back. By then, it was much too late. Tarleton
was safely across the Broad River at Hamiltons Ford.
But the American pursuit helped save Thomas
Young, the captured militiaman. When Tarleton and
his men, guided by the reluctant Goudelock, reached
the ford, it was almost dark. Someone told them the
river was &ldquo;swimming.&rdquo; Someone else, perhaps a
loyalist scout, rode up with word that Washington
and his cavalry were after them. Considerable confusion
ensued, as Tarleton and his officers conferred
on whether to flee down the river to some other
ford, attempt to swim the river in the dark, or stand
and fight. Everyone stopped thinking about Thomas
Young and another prisoner, a Virginian whom the
British had scooped up along the road. The two
Americans spurred their horses into the darkness,
and no one noticed they were gone.</p>
<p>Tarleton crossed the Broad River that night and
spent the next morning collecting his runaway dragoons
and other stragglers before riding down to
Cornwallis&rsquo;s camp at Turkey Creek. The British
commander already knew the bad news. Some of the
Legion cavalry had drifted into camp the previous
night. But Tarleton, as the field commander, was
required to make a detailed report.</p>
<p>According to Joseph McJunkin, whose father had
been taken prisoner by the British and was an
eyewitness, Cornwallis grew so agitated he plunged
his sword into the ground in front of his tent and
leaned on it while listening to the details of the
disaster. By the end of Tarleton&rsquo;s account, the earl
was leaning so hard on the hilt that the sword
snapped in half. He threw the broken blade on the
ground and swore he would recapture the lost light
infantry, Fusiliers, and Highlanders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The general exonerated Tarleton of all culpability
for the defeat at Cowpens. &ldquo;You have forfeited no
part of my esteem, as an officer,&rdquo; he assured Tarleton.
Cornwallis blamed the loss on the &ldquo;total misbehavior
of the troops.&rdquo; But he confided to Lord
Rawdon, the commander at Camden, that &ldquo;the late
affair has almost broke my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">

<p class="pcap">Of the three medals awarded
by Congress&mdash;a gold medal
to Morgan and silver medals
to Washington and Howard&mdash;only
the Howard medal has survived. The
Latin inscription reads: &ldquo;The
American Congress to John
Eager Howard, commander
of a regiment of infantry.&rdquo;
The medal is in the collection
of the Maryland Historical
Society.</p>
</div>
<p>On the same morning that Tarleton was making
his doleful report, Washington and Pickens returned
to Cowpens. On their ride back, they collected
several dozen&mdash;some versions make it as many as
100&mdash;additional British soldiers straggling through
the woods. At the battlefield they found only the two
surgeons caring for the wounded and a handful of
Pickens&rsquo; men guarding them. Daniel Morgan, knowing
Cornwallis would make a determined effort to
regain the prisoners, had crossed the Broad River on
the afternoon of the battle and headed northwest
toward Gilbert Town. Pickens and Washington caught
up to him there, and Morgan gave Pickens charge of
the prisoners, with orders to head for an upper ford
of the Catawba River. Decoying Cornwallis, Morgan
led his Continentals toward a lower ford of the same
river. In an exhausting five-day march, often in an
icy rain, both units got across this deep, swift-running
stream ahead of the pursuing British. The
prisoners were now beyond Cornwallis&rsquo;s reach. They
were soon marched to camps in Virginia, where the
men Morgan helped capture at Saratoga were held.</p>
<p>This final retreat, a vital maneuver that consolidated
the field victory at Cowpens, worsened
Morgan&rsquo;s sciatica. From the east bank of the Catawba,
he warned Greene that he would have to
leave the army. &ldquo;I grow worse every hour,&rdquo; he wrote.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ride or walk.&rdquo; As the rain continued to pour
down, Morgan had to abandon his tent and seek the
warmth of a private house. Greene immediately
rode from Cheraw Hills and took personal command
of the army. By the time Morgan departed for
Virginia on February 10, he was in such pain that he
had to be carried in a litter.</p>
<p>A grateful Congress showered the Cowpens victors
with praise and rewards. Morgan was voted a
gold medal, and Howard and Washington were
voted silver medals. Pickens received a silver sword.
Perhaps the most immediate result of the battle was
in the minds of the people of the South. The victory
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
sent a wave of hope through the Carolinas and
Georgia. It also changed attitudes in Congress
toward the southern States. John Mathews of South
Carolina told Greene that &ldquo;the intelligence ... seems
to have had a very sensible effect on <i>some folks</i>, for
as this is a convincing proof that something is to be
done in that department ... they seem at present to
be well disposed to give it every possible aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news had an exhilarating effect on Greene&rsquo;s
half of the southern army. He ordered a celebration
and praised Morgan extravagantly in the general
orders announcing the victory. A friend on Greene&rsquo;s
staff sent a copy to Morgan, adding, &ldquo;It was written
immediately after we heard the news, and during the
operation of some cherry bounce.&rdquo; To Francis
Marion, Greene wrote, &ldquo;After this, nothing will
appear difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This optimism soon faded. To the men in the field,
Cowpens did not seem particularly decisive. Banastre
Tarleton was soon back in action at the head of the
British cavalry. On February 1, from his sick bed,
Morgan wrote a despairing letter to Gov. Thomas
Jefferson of Virginia, describing the retreat of the
Southern army before Cornwallis. &ldquo;Our men [are]
almost naked,&rdquo; still too weak to fight him. &ldquo;Great
God what is the reason we can&rsquo;t have more men in
the field? How distressing it must be to an anxious
mind to see the country over run and destroyed for
want of assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The civil war between the rebels and the loyalists
continued in South Carolina, marked by the same
savage fratricidal strife. &ldquo;The scenes were awful,&rdquo;
Andrew Pickens recalled. Young James Collins, in
his simple, honest way, told the militiaman&rsquo;s side of
this story. Summing up his role at Cowpens, Collins
said he fired his &ldquo;little rifle five times, whether with
any effect or not, I do not know.&rdquo; The following day,
he and many other militiamen received &ldquo;some small
share of the plunder&rdquo; from the captured British
wagons. Then, &ldquo;taking care to get as much powder
as we could, we [the militia] disbanded and returned
to our old haunts, where we obtained a few days
rest.&rdquo; Within a week, Collins was again on his horse,
risking his life as a scout and messenger.</p>
<p>Only years later, with a full perspective of the war,
did the importance of Cowpens become clear. By
destroying Tarleton&rsquo;s Legion, Daniel Morgan crippled
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
the enemy&rsquo;s power to intimidate and suppress
the militia. Cornwallis was never able to replace the
regulars he lost at Cowpens. He had to abandon all
thought of dividing his field army&mdash;which meant that
British power did not extend much beyond the
perimeter of his camp. When he pursued Greene&rsquo;s
army deep into North Carolina, the partisans in
South Carolina rose in revolt. Eventually, Cornwallis
was forced to unite his decimated, half-starved regiments
with the British troops in Virginia, where they
were trapped by Gen. George Washington&rsquo;s army at
Yorktown in October 1781.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, meanwhile, Nathanael Greene
combined militia with his small regular army in the
style Morgan had originated at Cowpens. Though
Greene was forced to retreat without victory at Guilford
Courthouse (March 15, 1781), Hobkirks Hill
(April 25, 1781), and Eutaw Springs (September 8,
1781), the British army suffered such heavy losses in
these and other encounters that they soon abandoned
all their posts in the back country, including
the fort at Ninety Six, and retreated to a small
enclave around Charleston. There they remained,
impotent and besieged, until the war was almost over.</p>
<p>It took nine years for the U.S. Treasury to scrape
together the cash to buy Daniel Morgan the gold
medal voted him by Congress for Cowpens. In the
spring of 1790, this letter came to the Old Wagoner
at his home near Winchester, Virginia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr"><i>New York, March 25, 1790</i></span></p>

<p><i>This medal was put into my hands by Mr.
Jefferson, and it is with singular pleasure that I

<p>Cowpens was one of the most skillfully
fought battles in the annals of the
American military. It pitted a young
and ruthless commander of British
dragoons&mdash;a man widely feared and
hated in the South&mdash;against a brilliant
tactician and experienced leader of
American militia. The fighting was
short and decisive. In less than an
hour, three-fourths of the British were
killed or captured, many of them the
best light troops in the army. For Cornwallis,
the rout was another in a series
of disasters that led ultimately to final
defeat at Yorktown.</p>
<p>The park that preserves the scene of
this battle is located in upstate South
Carolina, 11 miles northwest of Gaffney
by way of S.C. 11. The original
park on this site was established in
1929 on an acre of ground marking the
point of some of the hardest fighting.
For the bicentennial of the battle, the
park was expanded to over 842 acres,
and many new facilities&mdash;among them
a visitor center, roads, trails, and
waysides&mdash;were built.</p>
<p>The battlefield is small enough for
visitors to stroll around and replay the
maneuvers of the opposing commanders.
A 1&frac14;-mile trail loops through the
heart of the park. Two of the first stops
are at the lines held by Howard&rsquo;s Continentals
and Pickens&rsquo; militia. Farther
along the trail you can stand where
Tarleton formed his troops into a line
of battle. From this point, the trail up
the Green River Road covers ground
over which the British advanced at
sunrise that cold January morning. The
pitched fighting between Continentals
and redcoats that decided the contest
occurred just beyond the bend in the
road.</p>
<p>The land is currently being restored
to its appearance at the time of the
battle. In 1781, this field was a grassy
meadow dotted with tall hardwoods.
A locally known pasturing ground, it
was used by Carolina farmers to fatten
cattle before sending them to low-country
markets.</p>
<p>Tarleton in his memoirs described it
as an &ldquo;open wood ... disadvantageous
for the Americans, and convenient for
the British.&rdquo; He expected to break
through the rebel lines, as he had so
often done in the past, and ride down
the fleeing remnants with his cavalry.</p>
<p>Morgan saw the same ground as
favoring him and based his plan of
battle on a shrewd appraisal of both
his foe and his own men. He was happy
enough that there was no swamp nearby
for his militia to flee to and unconcerned
that there were no natural obstacles
covering his wings from cavalry.
He knew his adversary, he claimed,
&ldquo;and was perfectly sure I should have
nothing but downright fighting. As to
retreat, it was the very thing I wished
to cut off all hope of.... When men are
forced to fight, they will sell their lives
dearly.&rdquo; So Morgan deployed his men
according to their abilities and handled
them in battle with rare skill. They rewarded
him, militia and regular alike,
with what was probably the patriots&rsquo;
best-fought battle of the war.</p>
<p>Cowpens was only one battle in a
long campaign. For perspective, nine
other sites of the War in the South
are described on the following pages.
Several of them are administered by
public agencies; a few are barely
marked and may be hard to find. Travelers
will find two works useful: <i>Landmarks
of the American Revolution</i> by
Mark M. Boatner III (1975) and <i>The
Bicentennial Guide to the American
Revolution, Volume 3, The War in the
South</i> by Sol Stember (1974).</p>

<h4 id="c6">Savannah 1778-79</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/i34a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="590" />
<p class="pcap">The British opened their campaign
against the South with
the capture of this city in late
1778. They went on to conquer
Georgia and threaten
the Carolinas. To retake the
city, French and American
infantry opened a siege in the
fall of 1779. The British repulsed
the allied attacks with
great losses. Some of the
hardest fighting swirled
around Spring Hill Redoubt.
Nothing remains of this earthwork.
A plaque on Railroad
Street is the only reminder of
the battle.</p>

<h4 id="c7">Charleston 1780</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig58">
<img src="images/i34b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="585" />
<p class="pcap">The British laid siege to this
city in spring 1780. Trapped
inside was the entire Southern
army, 5,000 troops under
Gen. Benjamin Lincoln.
When Lincoln surrendered,
it was one of the most crushing
defeats of the war for the
Continentals. Only a few evidences
of the war remain,
among them a tabby wall
(part of the patriots&rsquo; defensive
works) in Marion Square and
a statue of William Pitt, damaged
in the shelling, in a park
in the lower city.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="c8">Waxhaws 1780</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig59">
<img src="images/i34c.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="580" />
<p class="pcap">The only sizable force not
trapped inside Charleston was
a regiment of Continentals
under Abraham Buford. Pursuing
hard, Tarleton caught
them on May 29, 1780, in a
clearing. His dragoons and infantry
swarmed over Buford&rsquo;s
lines. The result was a slaughter.
Many Continentals were
killed trying to surrender. The
massacre inspired the epithet
&ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; Tarleton.</p>
<p class="pcapc">Site located 9 miles east of
Lancaster, S.C., on Rt. 522.

<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/i35.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="578" />
<p class="pcap">After the fall of Charleston,
Congress sent Gates south to
stop the British. On August
16 he collided with Cornwallis
outside this village. The battle
was another American disaster.
The militia broke and
ran, and the Continentals
were overwhelmed. This defeat
was the low point of the
war in the South. Historic
Camden preserves remnants
of the Revolutionary town.
The battlefield is several
miles north of town. This
stone marks the place
where the heroic DeKalb fell.</p>

<h4 id="c10">Kings Mountain 1780</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig61">
<img src="images/i35c.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="582" />
<p class="pcap">When Cornwallis invaded
North Carolina in autumn
1780, he sent Patrick
Ferguson ranging into the
upcountry. A band of &ldquo;over-mountain&rdquo;
men&mdash;tired of his
threats and depredations&mdash;trapped
him and his American
loyalists on this summit.
In a savage battle on October
7, they killed or wounded
a third of his men and captured
the rest. The defeat was
Cornwallis&rsquo;s first setback in
his campaign to conquer the
South. Administered by NPS.</p>

<p class="pcap">Armies under Nathanael
Greene and Cornwallis fought
one of the decisive battles of
the Revolutionary War here
on March 15. In two hours of
hard fighting, Cornwallis
drove Greene from the field,

<p class="pcap">Located on the main trading
route to the Cherokees, this
palisaded village was the
most important British outpost
in the South Carolina
back country. Greene laid
siege to the garrison here
from May 22 to June 19, 1781,
but could not subdue the
post. A relief force raised the
siege, which was soon evacuated
and burned. The star fort

<h4 id="c13">Eutaw Springs 1781</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig64">
<img src="images/i35f.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="580" />
<p class="pcap">The last major battle in the
lower South (September 8,
1781), Eutaw Springs matched
Greene with 2,200 troops
against 1,900 redcoats. The
outcome was a draw. The
British retreated to Charleston,
and there they remained
the rest of the war.</p>
<p class="pcapc">A memorial park stands on
Rt. 6. just east of Eutawville,

Marion.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig65">
<img src="images/i35g.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="576" />
<p class="pcap">Cornwallis&rsquo;s surrender at this
little port town on October
19, 1781, brought the war to
an effective end. The victory
was a consequence of the
Franco-American alliance.
French ships blockaded the
harbor and prevented resupply,
while Washington&rsquo;s
powerful force of Continentals
and French regulars besieged
the British by land.
After a long bombardment
and a night attack that captured
two redoubts, Cornwallis
asked for terms.</p>

<h3 id="c15">For Further Reading</h3>
<p>For those who wish to explore the
story of Cowpens in more depth, the
following books will be helpful. <i>Daniel
Morgan, Revolutionary Rifleman</i> by
Don Higgenbotham (1961) is a well-paced,
solidly researched narrative of
the Old Wagoner&rsquo;s adventurous life.
Still valuable, especially for its wealth
of quotations from Morgan&rsquo;s correspondence,
is James Graham&rsquo;s <i>Life
of General Morgan</i> (1856). On the
struggle for the South Carolina back-country,
<i>Ninety Six</i> by Robert D. Bass
(1978) is the best modern study. Edward
McCrady&rsquo;s two-volume work, <i>A
History of South Carolina in the Revolution</i>
(1901), is also useful. For personal
anecdotes about the savage civil
war between rebels and loyalists, <i>Traditions
and Reminiscences, Chiefly of
the American Revolution in the South</i>
by Joseph Johnson, M.D. (1851) is a
basic source book. Equally illuminating
is James Collins&rsquo; <i>Autobiography of
a Revolutionary Soldier</i>, published in
<i>Sixty Years in the Nueces Valley</i> (1930).
Biographies of other men who participated
in Cowpens are not numerous.
<i>Skyagunsta</i> by A. L. Pickens (1934)
mingles legend and fact about Andrew
Pickens. <i>Piedmont Partisan</i> by Chalmers
G. Davidson (1951) is a balanced
account of William Lee Davidson.
<i>James Jackson, Duelist and Militant
Statesman</i> by William O. Foster (1960)
is a competent study of the fiery Georgia
leader. <i>The Life of Major General
Nathanael Greene</i> by George Washington
Greene (1871) gives the reader a
look at the battle from the viewpoint
of the American commander in the
South. For the British side of the story,
one of the best accounts is Banastre
Tarleton&rsquo;s <i>A History of the Campaign
of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces
of North America</i> (1787), available
in a reprint edition. <i>The Green
Dragoon</i> by Robert D. Bass (1957) gives
a more objective view of Tarleton&rsquo;s meteoric
career. Two other useful books
are <i>Strictures on Lt. Col. Tarleton&rsquo;s History</i>
by Roderick Mackenzie (1788), an
officer who fought at Cowpens with
the 71st Regiment, and <i>The History of
the Origin, Progress and Termination
of the American War</i> by Charles Stedman
(1794), a British officer who was
extremely critical of Tarleton. Both
are available in reprint editions. <i>Cornwallis,
the American Adventure</i> by
Franklin and Mary Wickwire (1970) has
an excellent account of Cowpens&mdash;and
the whole war in the South&mdash;from the
viewpoint of Tarleton&rsquo;s commander.
<i>Rise and Fight Again</i> by Charles B.
Flood (1976) ably discusses the influence
of Cowpens and other Southern
battles on the ultimate decision at
Yorktown.</p>

<p>As the Nation&rsquo;s principal conservation agency, the
Department of the Interior has responsibility for
most of our nationally owned public lands and
natural resources. This responsibility includes
fostering the wisest use of our land and water
resources, protecting our fish and wildlife, preserving
the environmental and cultural values of our
national parks and historical places, and providing
for the enjoyment of life through outdoor recreation.
The Department assesses our energy and
mineral resources and works to assure that their
development is in the interest of all our people.
The Department also has a major responsibility for
American Indian reservation communities and for
people who live in island territories under U.S.
administration.</p>
